This is the Showing forth of the Inquiry of Herodotus of Halicarnassos  to the end that neither the deeds of men may be forgotten by lapse of time  nor the works great and marvellous  which have been produced some by Hellenes and some by Barbarians  may lose their renown; and especially that the causes may be remembered for which these waged war with one another.,mashup

Those of the Persians who have knowledge of history declare that the Phenicians first began the quarrel. These  they say  came from that which is called the Erythraian Sea to this of ours; and having settled in the land where they continue even now to dwell  set themselves forthwith to make long voyages by sea. And conveying merchandise of Egypt and of Assyria they arrived at other places and also at Argos; now Argos was at that time in all points the first of the States within that land which is now called Hellas;— the Phenicians arrived then at this land of Argos  and began to dispose of their ship's cargo: and on the fifth or sixth day after they had arrived  when their goods had been almost all sold  there came down to the sea a great company of women  and among them the daughter of the king; and her name  as the Hellenes also agree  was Io the daughter of Inachos. These standing near to the stern of the ship were buying of the wares such as pleased them most  when of a sudden the Phenicians  passing the word from one to another  made a rush upon them; and the greater part of the women escaped by flight  but Io and certain others were carried off. So they put them on board their ship  and forthwith departed  sailing away to Egypt.,mashup

In this manner the Persians report that Io came to Egypt  not agreeing therein with the Hellenes  and this they say was the first beginning of wrongs. Then after this  they say  certain Hellenes (but the name of the people they are not able to report ) put in to the city of Tyre in Phenicia and carried off the king's daughter Europa;— these would doubtless be Cretans;— and so they were quits for the former injury. After this however the Hellenes  they say  were the authors of the second wrong; for they sailed in to Aia of Colchis and to the river Phasis with a ship of war  and from thence  after they had done the other business for which they came  they carried off the king's daughter Medea: and the king of Colchis sent a herald to the land of Hellas and demanded satisfaction for the rape and to have his daughter back; but they answered that  as the Barbarians had given them no satisfaction for the rape of Io the Argive  so neither would they give satisfaction to the Barbarians for this.,mashup

In the next generation after this  they say  Alexander the son of Priam  having heard of these things  desired to get a wife for himself by violence from Hellas  being fully assured that he would not be compelled to give any satisfaction for this wrong  inasmuch as the Hellenes gave none for theirs. So he carried off Helen  and the Hellenes resolved to send messengers first and to demand her back with satisfaction for the rape; and when they put forth this demand  the others alleged to them the rape of Medea  saying that the Hellenes were now desiring satisfaction to be given to them by others  though they had given none themselves nor had surrendered the person when demand was made.,mashup

Up to this point  they say  nothing more happened than the carrying away of women on both sides; but after this the Hellenes were very greatly to blame; for they set the first example of war  making an expedition into Asia before the Barbarians made any into Europe. Now they say that in their judgment  though it is an act of wrong to carry away women by force  it is a folly to set one's heart on taking vengeance for their rape  and the wise course is to pay no regard when they have been carried away; for it is evident that they would never be carried away if they were not themselves willing to go. And the Persians say that they  namely the people of Asia  when their women were carried away by force  had made it a matter of no account  but the Hellenes on account of a woman of Lacedemon gathered together a great armament  and then came to Asia and destroyed the dominion of Priam; and that from this time forward they had always considered the Hellenic race to be their enemy: for Asia and the Barbarian races which dwell there the Persians claim as belonging to them; but Europe and the Hellenic race they consider to be parted off from them.,mashup

The Persians for their part say that things happened thus; and they conclude that the beginning of their quarrel with the Hellenes was on account of the taking of Ilion: but as regards Io the Phenicians do not agree with the Persians in telling the tale thus; for they deny that they carried her off to Egypt by violent means  and they say on the other hand that when they were in Argos she was intimate with the master of their ship  and perceiving that she was with child  she was ashamed to confess it to her parents  and therefore sailed away with the Phenicians of her own will  for fear of being found out. These are the tales told by the Persians and the Phenicians severally: and concerning these things I am not going to say that they happened thus or thus  but when I have pointed to the man who first within my own knowledge began to commit wrong against the Hellenes  I shall go forward further with the story  giving an account of the cities of men  small as well as great: for those which in old times were great have for the most part become small  while those that were in my own time great used in former times to be small: so then  since I know that human prosperity never continues steadfast  I shall make mention of both indifferently.,mashup

Croesus was Lydian by race  the son of Alyattes and ruler of the nations which dwell on this side of the river Halys; which river  flowing from the South between the Syrians and the Paphlagonians  runs out towards the North Wind into that Sea which is called the Euxine. This Croesus  first of all the Barbarians of whom we have knowledge  subdued certain of the Hellenes and forced them to pay tribute  while others he gained over and made them his friends. Those whom he subdued were the Ionians  the Aiolians  and the Dorians who dwell in Asia; and those whom he made his friends were the Lacedemonians. But before the reign of Croesus all the Hellenes were free; for the expedition of the Kimmerians  which came upon Ionia before the time of Croesus  was not a conquest of the cities but a plundering incursion only.,mashup

Now the supremacy which had belonged to the Heracleidai came to the family of Croesus  called Mermnadai  in the following manner:— Candaules  whom the Hellenes call Myrsilos  was ruler of Sardis and a descendant of Alcaios  son of Heracles: for Agron  the son of Ninos  the son of Belos  the son of Alcaios  was the first of the Heracleidai who became king of Sardis  and Candaules the son of Myrsos was the last; but those who were kings over this land before Agrond  were descendants of Lydos the son of Atys  whence this whole nation was called Lydian  having been before called Meonian. From these the Heracleidai  descended from Heracles and the slave-girl of Iardanos  obtained the government  being charged with it by reason of an oracle; and they reigned for two-and-twenty generations of men  five hundred and five years  handing on the power from father to son  till the time of Clandaules the son of Myrsos.,mashup

This Candaules then of whom I speak had become passionately in love with his own wife; and having become so  he deemed that his wife was fairer by far than all other women; and thus deeming  to Gyges the son of Daskylos (for he of all his spearmen was the most pleasing to him )  to this Gyges  I say  he used to impart as well the more weighty of his affairs as also the beauty of his wife  praising it above measure: and after no long time  since it was destined that evil should happen to Candaules  he said to Gyges as follows:Gyges  I think that thou dost not believe me when I tell thee of the beauty of my wife  for it happens that men's ears are less apt of belief than their eyes: contrive therefore means by which thou mayest look upon her naked. But he cried aloud and said:Master  what word of unwisdom is this which thou dost utter  bidding me look upon my mistress naked? When a woman puts off her tunic she puts off her modesty also. Moreover of old time those fair sayings have been found out by men  from which we ought to learn wisdom; and of these one is this — that each man should look on his own: but I believe indeed that she is of all women the fairest and I entreat thee not to ask of me that which it is not lawful for me to do.,mashup

For I will contrive it so from the first that she shall not even perceive that she has been seen by thee. I will place thee in the room where we sleep  behind the open door; and after I have gone in  my wife also will come to lie down. Now there is a seat near the entrance of the room  and upon this she will lay her garments as she takes them off one by one; and so thou wilt be able to gaze upon her at full leisure.

He then  since he might not avoid it  gave consent: and Candaules  when he considered that it was time to rest  led Gyges to the chamber; and straightway after this the woman also appeared: and Gyges looked upon her after she came in and as she laid down her garments; and when she had her back turned towards him  as she went to the bed  then he slipped away from his hiding-place and was going forth. And as he went out  the woman caught sight of him  and perceiving that which had been done by her husband she did not cry out  though struck with shame  but she made as though she had not perceived the matter  meaning to avenge herself upon Candaules: for among the Lydians as also among most other Barbarians it is a shame even for a man to be seen naked.,mashup

At the time then she kept silence  as I say  and made no outward sign; but as soon as day had dawned  and she made ready those of the servants whom she perceived to be the most attached to herself  and after that she sent to summon Gyges. He then  not supposing that anything of that which had been done was known to her  came upon her summons; for he had been accustomed before to go whenever the queen summoned him. And when Gyges was come  the woman said to him these words:There are now two ways open to thee  Gyges  and I give thee the choice which of the two thou wilt prefer to take. Either thou must slay Candaules and possess both me and the kingdom of Lydia  or thou must thyself here on the spot be slain  so that thou mayest not in future  by obeying Candaules in all things  see that which thou shouldest not. Either he must die who formed this design  or thou who hast looked upon me naked and done that which is not accounted lawful. For a time then Gyges was amazed at these words  and afterwards he began to entreat her that she would not bind him by necessity to make such a choice: then however  as he could not prevail with her  but saw that necessity was in truth set before him either to slay his master or to be himself slain by others  he made the choice to live himself; and he inquired further as follows:Since thou dost compel me to take my master's life against my own will  let me hear from thee also what is the manner in which we shall lay hands upon him. And she answering said:From that same place shall the attempt be  where he displayed me naked; and we will lay hands upon him as he sleeps.,mashup

Then afterwards  while Candaules was sleeping  Gyges came privily up to him and slew him  and he obtained both his wife and his kingdom: of him moreover Archilochos the Parian  who lived about that time  made mention in a trimeter iambic verse.,mashup

He obtained the kingdom however and was strengthened in it by means of the Oracle at Delphi; for when the Lydians were angry because of the fate of Candaules  and had risen in arms  a treaty was made between the followers of Gyges and the other Lydians to this effect  that if the Oracle should give answer that he was to be king of the Lydians  he should be king  and if not  he should give back the power to the sons of Heracles. So the Oracle gave answer  and Gyges accordingly became king: yet the Pythian prophetess said this also  that vengeance for the Heracleidai should come upon the descendants of Gyges in the fifth generation. Of this oracle the Lydians and their kings made no account until it was in fact fulfilled.,mashup

This Gyges was the first of the Barbarians within our knowledge who dedicated votive offerings at Delphi  except only Midas the son of Gordias king of Phrygia  who dedicated for an offering the royal throne on which he sat before all to decide causes; and this throne  a sight worth seeing  stands in the same place with the bowls of Gyges. This gold and silver which Gyges dedicated is called Gygian by the people of Delphi  after the name of him who offered it. Now Gyges also  as soon as he became king  led an army against Miletos and Smyrna  and he took the lower town of Colophon: but no other great deed did he do in his reign  which lasted eight-and-thirty years  therefore we will pass him by with no more mention than has already been made ,mashup

He made war with those of Miletos  having received this war as an inheritance from his father: for he used to invade their land and besiege Miletos in the following manner:— whenever there were ripe crops upon the land  then he led an army into their confines  making his march to the sound of pipes and harps and flutes both of male and female tone: and when he came to the Milesian land  he neither pulled down the houses that were in the fields  nor set fire to them nor tore off their doors  but let them stand as they were; the trees however and the crops that were upon the land he destroyed  and then departed by the way he came: for the men of Miletos had command of the sea  so that it was of no use for his army to blockade them: and he abstained from pulling down the houses to the end that the Milesians might have places to dwell in while they sowed and tilled the land  and by the means of their labour he might have somewhat to destroy when he made his invasion.,mashup

Thus he continued to war with them for eleven years; and in the course of these years the Milesians suffered two great defeats  once when they fought a battle in the district of Limenion in their own land  and again in the plain of Maiander. Now for six of the eleven years Sadyattes the son of Ardys was still ruler of the Lydians  the same who was wont to invade the land of Miletos at the times mentioned; for this Sadyattes was he who first began the war: but for the five years which followed these first six the war was carried on by Alyattes the son of Sadyattes  who received it as an inheritance from his father (as I have already said ) and applied himself to it earnestly. And none of the Ionians helped those of Miletos bear the burden of this war except only the men of Chios. These came to their aid to pay back like with like  for the Milesians had formerly assisted the Chians throughout their war with the people of Erythrai.,mashup

Then in the twelfth year of the war  when standing corn was being burnt by the army of the Lydians  it happened as follows:— as soon as the corn was kindled  it was driven by a violent wind and set fire to the temple of Athene surnamed of Assessos; and the temple being set on fire was burnt down to the ground. Of this no account was made then; but afterwards when the army had returned to Sardis  Alyattes fell sick  and as his sickness lasted long  he sent messengers to inquire of the Oracle at Delphi  either being advised to do so by some one  or because he himself thought it best to send and inquire of the god concerning his sickness. But when these arrived at Delphi  the Pythian prophetess said that she would give them no answer  until they should have built up again the temple of Athene which they had burnt at Assessos in the land of Miletos.,mashup

Thus much I know by the report of the people of Delphi; but the Milesians add to this that Periander the son of Kypselos  being a special guest-friend of Thrasybulos the then despot of Miletos  heard of the oracle which had been given to Alyattes  and sending a messenger told Thrasybulos  in order that he might have knowledge of it beforehand and take such counsel as the case required.

And Alyattes  when this answer was reported to him  sent a herald forthwith to Miletos  desiring to make a truce with Thrasybulos and the Milesians for so long a time as he should be building the temple. He then was being sent as envoy to Miletos; and Thrasybulos in the meantime being informed beforehand of the whole matter and knowing what Alyattes was meaning to do  contrived this device:— he gathered together in the market-place all the store of provisions which was found in the city  both his own and that which belonged to private persons; and he proclaimed to the Milesians that on a signal given by him they should all begin to drink and make merry with one another.,mashup

For Alyattes  who thought that there was a great famine in Miletos and that the people had been worn down to the extreme of misery  heard from the herald  when he returned from Miletos  the opposite to that which he himself supposed. And after this the peace was made between them on condition of being guest-friends and allies to one another  and Alyattes built two temples to Athene at Assessos in place of one  and himself recovered from his sickness.

In his life  say the Corinthians  (and with them agree the Lesbians )  there happened to him a very great marvel  namely that Arion of Methymna was carried ashore at Tainaron upon a dolphin's back.

This Arion  they say  who for the most part of his time stayed with Periander  conceived a desire to sail to Italy and Sicily; and after he had there acquired large sums of money  he wished to return again to Corinth. He set forth therefore from Taras  and as he had faith in Corinthians more than in other men  he hired a ship with a crew of Corinthians. These  the story says  when out in open sea  formed a plot to cast Arion overboard and so possess his wealth; and he having obtained knowledge of this made entreaties to them  offering them his wealth and asking them to grant him his life. With this however he did not prevail upon them  but the men who were conveying him bade him either slay himself there  that he might receive burial on the land  or leap straightway into the sea. So Arion being driven to a strait entreated them that  since they were so minded  they would allow him to take his stand in full minstrel's garb upon the deck of the ship and sing; and he promised to put himself to death after he had sung. They then  well pleased to think that they should hear the best of all minstrels upon earth  drew back from the stern towards the middle of the ship; and he put on the full minstrel's garb and took his lyre  and standing on the deck performed the Orthian measure. Then as the measure ended  he threw himself into the sea just as he was  in his full minstrel's garb; and they went on sailing away to Corinth  but him  they say  a dolphin supported on its back and brought him to shore at Tainaron: and when he had come to land he proceeded to Corinth with his minstrel's garb. Thither having arrived he related all that had been done; and Periander doubting of his story kept Arion in guard and would let him go nowhere  while he kept careful watch for those who had conveyed him. When these came  he called them and inquired of them if they had any report to make of Arion; and when they said that he was safe in Italy and that they had left him at Taras faring well  Arion suddenly appeared before them in the same guise as when he made his leap from the ship; and they being struck with amazement were no longer able to deny when they were questioned. This is the tale told by the Corinthians and Lesbians alike  and there is at Tainaron a votive offering of Arion of no great size  namely a bronze figure of a man upon a dolphin's back.,mashup

Alyattes the Lydian  when he had thus waged war against the Milesians  afterwards died  having reigned seven-and-fifty years. This king  when he recovered from his sickness  dedicated a votive offering at Delphi (being the second of his house who had so done )  namely a great mixing-bowl of silver with a stand for it of iron welded together  which last is a sight worth seeing above all the offerings at Delphi and the work of Glaucos the Chian  who of all men first found out the art of welding iron.,mashup

And Croesus  supposing that what he reported was true  said:May the gods put it into the minds of the dwellers of the islands to come with horses against the sons of the Lydians! And he answered and said:O king  I perceive that thou dost earnestly desire to catch the men of the islands on the mainland riding upon horses; and it is not unreasonable that thou shouldest wish for this: what else however thinkest thou the men of the islands desire and have been praying for ever since the time they heard that thou wert about to build ships against them  than that they might catch the Lydians upon the sea  so as to take vengeance upon thee for the Hellenes who dwell upon the mainland  whom thou dost hold enslaved ? Croesus  they say  was greatly pleased with this conclusion  and obeying his suggestion  for he judged him to speak suitably  he stopped his building of ships; and upon that he formed a friendship with the Ionians dwelling in the islands.,mashup

So Solon  having left his native country for this reason and for the sake of seeing various lands  came to Amasis in Egypt  and also to Croesus at Sardis. Having there arrived he was entertained as a guest by Croesus in the king's palace; and afterwards  on the third or fourth day  at the bidding of Croesus his servants led Solon round to see his treasuries; and they showed him all things  how great and magnificent they were: and after he had looked upon them all and examined them as he had occasion  Croesus asked him as follows:Athenian guest  much report of thee has come to us  both in regard to thy wisdom and thy wanderings  how that in thy search for wisdom thou hast traversed many lands to see them; now therefore a desire has come upon me to ask thee whether thou hast seen any whom thou deemest to be of all men the most happy. This he asked supposing that he himself was the happiest of men; but Solon  using no flattery but the truth only  said:Yes  O king  Tellos the Athenian. And Croesus  marvelling at that which he said  asked him earnestly:In what respect dost thou judge Tellos to be the most happy ? And he said:Tellos  in the first place  living while his native State was prosperous  had sons fair and good and saw from all of them children begotten and living to grow up; and secondly he had what with us is accounted wealth  and after his life a most glorious end: for when a battle was fought by the Athenians at Eleusis against the neighbouring people  he brought up supports and routed the foe and there died by a most fair death; and the Athenians buried him publicly where he fell  and honoured him greatly.,mashup

So when Solon had moved Croesus to inquire further by the story of Tellos  recounting how many points of happiness he had  the king asked again whom he had seen proper to be placed next after this man  supposing that he himself would certainly obtain at least the second place; but he replied:Cleobis and Biton: for these  who were of Argos by race  possessed a sufficiency of wealth and  in addition to this  strength of body such as I shall tell. Both equally had won prizes in the games  and moreover the following tale is told of them:— There was a feast of Hera among the Argives and it was by all means necessary that their mother should be borne in a car to the temple. But since their oxen were not brought up in time from the field  the young men  barred from all else by lack of time  submitted themselves to the yoke and drew the wain  their mother being borne by them upon it; and so they brought it on for five-and-forty furlongs  and came to the temple. Then after they had done this and had been seen by the assembled crowd  there came to their life a most excellent ending; and in this the deity declared that it was better for man to die than to continue to live. For the Argive men were standing round and extolling the strength of the young men  while the Argive women were extolling the mother to whose lot it had fallen to have such sons; and the mother being exceedingly rejoiced both by the deed itself and by the report made of it  took her stand in front of the image of the goddess and prayed that she would give to Cleobis and Biton her sons  who had honoured her greatly  that gift which is best for man to receive: and after this prayer  when they had sacrificed and feasted  the young men lay down to sleep within the temple itself  and never rose again  but were held bound in this last end. And the Argives made statues in the likeness of them and dedicated them as offerings at Delphi  thinking that they had proved themselves most excellent.,mashup

Thus Solon assigned the second place in respect of happiness to these: and Croesus was moved to anger and said:Athenian guest  hast thou then so cast aside our prosperous state as worth nothing  that thou dost prefer to us even men of private station ? And he said:Croesus  thou art inquiring about human fortunes of one who well knows that the Deity is altogether envious and apt to disturb our lot. For in the course of long time a man may see many things which he would not desire to see  and suffer also many things which he would not desire to suffer. The limit of life for a man I lay down at seventy years: and these seventy years give twenty-five thousand and two hundred days  not reckoning for any intercalated month. Then if every other one of these years shall be made longer by one month  that the seasons may be caused to come round at the due time of the year  the intercalated months will be in number five-and-thirty besides the seventy years; and of these months the days will be one thousand and fifty. Of all these days  being in number twenty-six thousand two hundred and fifty  which go to the seventy years  one day produces nothing at all which resembles what another brings with it. Thus then  O Croesus  man is altogether a creature of accident. As for thee  I perceive that thou art both great in wealth and king of many men  but that of which thou didst ask me I cannot call thee yet  until I learn that thou hast brought thy life to a fair ending: for the very rich man is not at all to be accounted more happy than he who has but his subsistence from day to day  unless also the fortune go with him of ending his life well in possession of all things fair. For many very wealthy men are not happy  while many who have but a moderate living are fortunate; and in truth the very rich man who is not happy has two advantages only as compared with the poor man who is fortunate  whereas this latter has many as compared with the rich man who is not happy. The rich man is able better to fulfil his desire  and also to endure a great calamity if it fall upon him; whereas the other has advantage over him in these things which follow:— he is not indeed able equally with the rich man to endure a calamity or to fulfil his desire  but these his good fortune keeps away from him  while he is sound of limb  free from disease  untouched by suffering  the father of fair children and himself of comely form; and if in addition to this he shall end his life well  he is worthy to be called that which thou seekest  namely a happy man; but before he comes to his end it is well to hold back and not to call him yet happy but only fortunate. Now to possess all these things together is impossible for one who is mere man  just as no single land suffices to supply all tings for itself  but one thing it has and another it lacks  and the land that has the greatest number of things is the best: so also in the case of a man  no single person is complete in himself  for one thing he has and another he lacks; but whosoever of men continues to the end in possession of the greatest number of these things and then has a gracious ending of his life  he is by me accounted worthy  O king  to receive this name. But we must of every thing examine the end and how it will turn out at the last  for to many God shows but a glimpse of happiness and then plucks them up by the roots and overturns them.,mashup

After Solon had departed  a great retribution from God came upon Croesus  probably because he judged himself to be the happiest of all men. First there came and stood by him a dream  which showed to him the truth of the evils that were about to come to pass in respect of his son. Now Croesus had two sons  of whom one was deficient  seeing that he was deaf and dumb  while the other far surpassed his companions of the same age in all things: and the name of this last was Atys. As regards this Atys then  the dream signified to Croesus that he should lose him by the blow of an iron spear-point: and when he rose up from sleep and considered the matter with himself  he was struck with fear on account of the dream; and first he took for his son a wife; and whereas his son had been wont to lead the armies of the Lydians  he now no longer sent him forth anywhere on any such business; and the javelins and lances and all such things which men use for fighting he conveyed out of the men's apartments and piled them up in the inner bed-chambers  for fear lest something hanging up might fall down upon his son.,mashup

Then while he was engaged about the marriage of his son  there came to Sardis a man under a misfortune and with hands not clean  a Phrygian by birth and of the royal house. This man came to the house of Croesus  and according to the customs which prevail in that land made request that he might have cleansing; and Croesus gave him cleansing: now the manner of cleansing among the Lydians is the same almost as that which the Hellenes use. So when Croesus had done that which was customary  he asked of him whence he came and who he was  saying as follows:Man  who art thou  and from what region of Phrygia didst thou come to sit upon my hearth? And whom of men or women didst thou slay ? And he replied:O king  I am the son of Gordias  the son of Midas  and I am called Adrastos; and I slew my own brother against my will  and therefore am I here  having been driven forth by my father and deprived of all that I had. And Croesus answered thus:Thou art  as it chances  the offshoot of men who are our friends and thou hast come to friends  among whom thou shalt want of nothing so long as thou shalt remain in our land: and thou wilt find it most for thy profit to bear this misfortune as lightly as may be. So he had his abode with Croesus.,mashup

During this time there was produced in the Mysian Olympos a boar of monstrous size. This  coming down from the mountain aforesaid  ravaged the fields of the Mysians  and although the Mysians went out against it often  yet they could do it no hurt  but rather received hurt themselves from it; so at length messengers came from the Mysians to Croesus and said:O king  there has appeared in our land a boar of monstrous size  which lays waste our fields; and we  desiring eagerly to take it  are not able: now therefore we ask of thee to send with us thy son and also a chosen band of young men with dogs  that we may destroy it out of our land. Thus they made request  and Croesus calling to mind the words of the dream spoke to them as follows:As touching my son  make no further mention of him in this matter; for I will not send him with you  seeing that he is newly married and is concerned now with the affairs of his marriage: but I will send with you chosen men of the Lydians and the whole number of my hunting dogs  and I will give command to those who go  to be as zealous as may be in helping you to destroy the wild beast out of your land.,mashup

Thus he made reply  and while the Mysians were being contented with this answer  there came in also the son of Croesus  having heard of the request made by the Mysians: and when Croesus said that he would not send his son with them  the young man spoke as follows:My father  in times past the fairest and most noble part was allotted to us  to go out continually to wars and to the chase and so have good repute; but now thou hast debarred me from both of these  although thou hast not observed in me any cowardly or faint-hearted spirit. And now with what face must I appear when I go to and from the market- place of the city?

With thought of this vision therefore I both urged on this marriage for thee  and I refuse now to send thee upon the matter which is being taken in hand  having a care of thee that I may steal thee from thy fate at least for the period of my own life  if by any means possible for me to do so.

Thou sayest the dream declared that I should end my life by means of a spear-point of iron: but what hands has a boar  or what spear-point of iron  of which thou art afraid? If the dream had told thee that I should end my life by a tusk  or any other thing which resembles that  it would be right for thee doubtless to do as thou art doing; but it said 'by a spear- point.'

Now therefore  since having first received kindness from me thou art bound to requite me with kindness  I ask of thee to be the protector of my son who goes forth to the chase  lest any evil robbers come upon you by the way to do you harm; and besides this thou too oughtest to go where thou mayest become famous by thy deeds  for it belongs to thee as an inheritance from thy fathers so to do  and moreover thou hast strength for it.,mashup

Then the guest  he who had been cleansed of manslaughter  whose name was Adrastos  hurling a spear at it missed the boar and struck the son of Croesus.

But Croesus hearing this pitied Adrastos  although he was himself suffering so great an evil of his own  and said to him:Guest  I have already received from thee all the satisfaction that is due  seeing that thou dost condemn thyself to suffer death; and not thou alone art the cause of this evil  except in so far as thou wert the instrument of it against thine own will  but some one  as I suppose  of the gods  who also long ago signified to me that which was about to be. So Croesus buried his son as was fitting: but Adrastos the son of Gordias  the son of Midas  he who had been the slayer of his own brother and the slayer also of the man who had cleansed him  when silence came of all men round about the tomb  recognising that he was more grievously burdened by misfortune than all men of whom he knew  slew himself upon the grave.,mashup

For two years then Croesus remained quiet in his mourning  because he was deprived of his son: but after this period of time the overthrowing of the rule of Astyages the son of Kyaxares by Cyrus the son of Cambyses  and the growing greatness of the Persians caused Croesus to cease from his mourning  and led him to a care of cutting short the power of the Persians  if by any means he might  while yet it was in growth and before they should have become great. So having formed this design he began forthwith to make trial of the Oracles  both those of the Hellenes and that in Libya  sending messengers some to one place and some to another  some to go to Delphi  others to Abai of the Phokians  and others to Dodona; and some were sent to the shrine of Amphiaraos and to that of Trophonios  others to Branchidai in the land of Miletos: these are the Oracles of the Hellenes to which Croesus sent messengers to seek divination; and others he sent to the shrine of Ammon in Libya to inquire there. Now he was sending the messengers abroad to the end that he might try the Oracles and find out what knowledge they had  so that if they should be found to have knowledge of the truth  he might send and ask them secondly whether he should attempt to march against the Persians.,mashup

And to the Lydians whom he sent to make trial of the Oracles he gave charge as follows — that from the day on which they set out from Sardis they should reckon up the number of the days following and on the hundredth day they should consult the Oracles  asking what Croesus the son of Alyattes king of the Lydians chanced then to be doing: and whatever the Oracles severally should prophesy  this they should cause to be written down and bear it back to him. Now what the other Oracles prophesied is not by any reported  but at Delphi  so soon as the Lydians entered the sanctuary of the temple to consult the god and asked that which they were commanded to ask  the Pythian prophetess spoke thus in hexameter measure:But the number of sand I know  and the measure of drops in the ocean; The dumb man I understand  and I hear the speech of the speechless: And there hath come to my soul the smell of a strong-shelled tortoise Boiling in caldron of bronze  and the flesh of a lamb mingled with it; Under it bronze is laid  it hath bronze as a clothing upon it.,mashup

When the Pythian prophetess had uttered this oracle  the Lydians caused the prophecy to be written down  and went away at once to Sardis. And when the rest also who had been sent round were there arrived with the answers of the Oracles  then Croesus unfolded the writings one by one and looked upon them: and at first none of them pleased him  but when he heard that from Delphi  forthwith he did worship to the god and accepted the answer  judging that the Oracle at Delphi was the only true one  because it had found out what he himself had done. For when he had sent to the several Oracles his messengers to consult the gods  keeping well in mind the appointed day he contrived the following device — he thought of something which it would be impossible to discover or to conceive of  and cutting up a tortoise and a lamb he boiled them together himself in a caldron of bronze  laying a cover of bronze over them.,mashup

This then was the answer given to Croesus from Delphi; and as regards the answer of Amphiaraos  I cannot tell what he replied to the Lydians after they had done the things customary in his temple  for there is no record of this any more than of the others  except only that Croesus thought that he also possessed a true Oracle.,mashup

After this with great sacrifices he endeavoured to win the favour of the god at Delphi: for of all the animals that are fit for sacrifice he offered three thousand of each kind  and he heaped up couches overlaid with gold and overlaid with silver  and cups of gold  and robes of purple  and tunics  making of them a great pyre  and this he burnt up  hoping by these means the more to win over the god to the side of the Lydians: and he proclaimed to all the Lydians that every one of them should make sacrifice with that which each man had. And when he had finished the sacrifice  he melted down a vast quantity of gold  and of it he wrought half-plinths making them six palms in length and three in breadth  and in height one palm; and their number was one hundred and seventeen. Of these four were of pure gold weighing two talents and a half each  and others of gold alloyed with silver weighing two talents. And he caused to be made also an image of a lion of pure gold weighing ten talents; which lion  when the temple of Delphi was being burnt down  fell from off the half-plinths  for upon these it was set  and is placed now in the treasury of the Corinthians  weighing six talents and a half  for three talents and a half were melted away from it.,mashup

So Croesus having finished all these things sent them to Delphi  and with them these besides:— two mixing bowls of great size  one of gold and the other of silver  of which the golden bowl was placed on the right hand as one enters the temple  and the silver on the left  but the places of these also were changed after the temple was burnt down  and the golden bowl is now placed in the treasury of the people of Clazomenai  weighing eight and a half talents and twelve pounds over  while the silver one is placed in the corner of the vestibule and holds six hundred amphors (being filled with wine by the Delphians on the feast of the Theophania ): this the people of Delphi say is the work of Theodoros the Samian  and  as I think  rightly  for it is evident to me that the workmanship is of no common kind: moreover Croesus sent four silver wine-jars  which stand in the treasury of the Corinthians  and two vessels for lustral water  one of gold and the other of silver  of which the gold one is inscribedfrom the Lacedemonians  who say that it is their offering: therein however they do not speak rightly; for this also is from Croesus  but one of the Delphians wrote the inscription upon it  desiring to gratify the Lacedemonians; and his name I know but will not make mention of it. The boy through whose hand the water flows is from the Lacedemonians  but neither of the vessels for lustral water. And many other votive offerings Croesus sent with these  not specially distinguished  among which are certain castings of silver of a round shape  and also a golden figure of a woman three cubits high  which the Delphians say is a statue of the baker of Croesus. Moreover Croesus dedicated the ornaments from his wife's neck and her girdles.,mashup

To the Lydians who were to carry these gifts to the temples Croesus gave charge that they should ask the Oracles this question also — whether Croesus should march against the Persians  and if so  whether he should join with himself any army of men as his friends. And when the Lydians had arrived at the places to which they had been sent and had dedicated the votive offerings  they inquired of the Oracles and said:Croesus  king of the Lydians and of other nations  considering that these are the only true Oracles among men  presents to you gifts such as your revelations deserve  and asks you again now whether he shall march against the Persians  and if so  whether he shall join with himself any army of men as allies. They inquired thus  and the answers of both the Oracles agreed in one  declaring to Croesus that if he should march against the Persians he should destroy a great empire: and they counselled him to find out the most powerful of the Hellenes and join these with himself as friends.,mashup

So when the answers were brought back and Croesus heard them  he was delighted with the oracles  and expecting that he would certainly destroy the kingdom of Cyrus  he sent again to Pytho  and presented to the men of Delphi  having ascertained the number of them  two staters of gold for each man: and in return for this the Delphians gave to Croesus and to the Lydians precedence in consulting the Oracle and freedom from all payments  and the right to front seats at the games  with this privilege also for all time  that any one of them who wished should be allowed to become a citizen of Delphi.,mashup

And having made presents to the men of Delphi  Croesus consulted the Oracle the third time; for from the time when he learnt the truth of the Oracle  he made abundant use of it. And consulting the Oracle he inquired whether his monarchy would endure for a long time.

By these lines when they came to him Croesus was pleased more than by all the rest  for he supposed that a mule would never be ruler of the Medes instead of a man  and accordingly that he himself and his heirs would never cease from their rule. Then after this he gave thought to inquire which people of the Hellenes he should esteem the most powerful and gain over to himself as friends. And inquiring he found that the Lacedemonians and the Athenians had the pre-eminence  the first of the Dorian and the others of the Ionian race. For these were the most eminent races in ancient time  the second being a Pelasgian and the first a Hellenic race: and the one never migrated from its place in any direction  while the other was very exceedingly given to wanderings; for in the reign of Deucalion this race dwelt in Pthiotis  and in the time of Doros the son of Hellen in the land lying below Ossa and Olympos  which is called Histiaiotis; and when it was driven from Histiaiotis by the sons of Cadmos  it dwelt in Pindos and was called Makednian; and thence it moved afterwards to Dryopis  and from Dryopis it came finally to Peloponnesus  and began to be called Dorian.,mashup

What language however the Pelasgians used to speak I am not able with certainty to say. But if one must pronounce judging by those that still remain of the Pelasgians who dwelt in the city of Creston above the Tyrsenians  and who were once neighbours of the race now called Dorian  dwelling then in the land which is now called Thessaliotis  and also by those that remain of the Pelasgians who settled at Plakia and Skylake in the region of the Hellespont  who before that had been settlers with the Athenians  and of the natives of the various other towns which are really Pelasgian  though they have lost the name — if one must pronounce judging by these  the Pelasgians used to speak a Barbarian language. If therefore all the Pelasgian race was such as these  then the Attic race  being Pelasgian  at the same time when it changed and became Hellenic  unlearnt also its language. For the people of Creston do not speak the same language with any of those who dwell about them  nor yet do the people of Phakia  but they speak the same language one as the other: and by this it is proved that they still keep unchanged the form of language which they brought with them when they migrated to these places.,mashup

Of these races then Croesus was informed that the Athenian was held subject and torn with faction by Peisistratos the son of Hippocrates  who then was despot of the Athenians. For to Hippocrates  when as a private citizen he went to view the Olympic games  a great marvel had occurred. After he had offered the sacrifice  the caldrons which were standing upon the hearth  full of pieces of flesh and of water  boiled without fire under them and ran over. And Chilon the Lacedemonian  who chanced to have been present and to have seen the marvel  advised Hippocrates first not to bring into his house a wife to bear him children  and secondly  if he happened to have one already  to dismiss her  and if he chanced to have a son  to disown him. When Chilon had thus recommended  Hippocrates  they say  was not willing to be persuaded  and so there was born to him afterwards this Peisistratos; who  when the Athenians of the shore were at feud with those of the plain  Megacles the son of Alcmaion being leader of the first faction  and Lycurgos the son of Aristolaides of that of the plain  aimed at the despotism for himself and gathered a third party. So then  after having collected supporters and called himself leader of the men of the mountain-lands  he contrived a device as follows:— he inflicted wounds upon himself and upon his mules  and then drove his car into the market-place  as if he had just escaped from his opponents  who  as he alleged  had desired to kill him when he was driving into the country: and he asked the commons that he might obtain some protection from them  for before this he had gained reputation in his command against the Megarians  during which he took Nisaia and performed other signal service. And the commons of the Athenians being deceived gave him those men chosen from the dwellers in the city who became not indeed the spear-men of Peisistratos but his club-men; for they followed behind him bearing wooden clubs. And these made insurrection with Peisistratos and obtained possession of the Acropolis. Then Peisistratos was ruler of the Athenians  not having disturbed the existing magistrates nor changed the ancient laws; but he administered the State under that constitution of things which was already established  ordering it fairly and well.,mashup

However  no long time after this the followers of Megacles and those of Lycurgos joined together and drove him forth. Thus Peisistratos had obtained possession of Athens for the first time  and thus he lost the power before he had it firmly rooted. But those who had driven out Peisistratos became afterwards at feud with one another again. And Megacles  harassed by the party strife  sent a message to Peisistratos asking whether he was willing to have his daughter to wife on condition of becoming despot. And Peisistratos having accepted the proposal and made an agreement on these terms  they contrived with a view to his return a device the most simple by far  as I think  that ever was practised  considering at least that it was devised at a time when the Hellenic race had been long marked off from the Barbarian as more skilful and further removed from foolish simplicity  and among the Athenians who are accounted the first of the Hellenes in ability. In the deme of Paiania there was a woman whose name was Phya  in height four cubits all but three fingers  and also fair of form. This woman they dressed in full armour and caused her to ascend a chariot and showed her the bearing in which she might best beseem her part  and so they drove to the city  having sent on heralds to run before them  who  when they arrived at the city  spoke that which had been commanded them  saying as follows:O Athenians  receive with favour Peisistratos  whom Athene herself  honouring him most of all men  brings back to her Acropolis. So the heralds went about hither and thither saying this  and straightway there came to the demes in the country round a report that Athene was bringing Peisistratos back  while at the same time the men of the city  persuaded that the woman was the very goddess herself  were paying worship to the human creature and receiving Peisistratos.,mashup

So having received back the despotism in the manner which has been said  Peisistratos according to the agreement made with Megacles married the daughter of Megacles; but as he had already sons who were young men  and as the descendants of Alcmaion were said to be under a curse  therefore not desiring that children should be born to him from his newly-married wife  he had commerce with her not in the accustomed manner. And at first the woman kept this secret  but afterwards she told her mother  whether in answer to her inquiry or not I cannot tell; and the mother told her husband Megacles. He then was very indignant that he should be dishonoured by Peisistratos; and in his anger straightway he proceeded to compose his quarrel with the men of his faction. And when Peisistratos heard of that which was being done against himself  he departed wholly from the land and came to Eretria  where he took counsel together with his sons: and the advice of Hippias having prevailed  that they should endeavour to win back the despotism  they began to gather gifts of money from those States which owed them obligations for favours received: and many contributed great sums  but the Thebans surpassed the rest in the giving of money. Then  not to make the story long  time elapsed and at last everything was prepared for their return. For certain Argives came as mercenaries from the Peloponnesus  and a man of Naxos had come to them of his own motion  whose name was Lygdamis  and showed very great zeal in providing both money and men.,mashup

So starting from Eretria after the lapse of ten years they returned back; and in Attica the first place of which they took possession was Marathon. While they were encamping here  their partisans from the city came to them  and also others flowed in from the various demes  to whom despotic rule was more welcome than freedom. So these were gathering themselves together; but the Athenians in the city  so long as Peisistratos was collecting the money  and afterwards when he took possession of Marathon  made no account of it; but when they heard that he was marching from Marathon towards the city  then they went to the rescue against him. These then were going in full force to fight against the returning exiles  and the forces of Peisistratos  as they went towards the city starting from Marathon  met them just when they came to the temple of Athene Pallenis  and there encamped opposite to them. Then moved by divine guidance there came into the presence of Peisistratos Amphilytos the Arcarnanian  a soothsayer  who approaching him uttered an oracle in hexameter verse  saying thus:But now the cast hath been made and the net hath been widely extended  And in the night the tunnies will dart through the moon-lighted waters.,mashup

This oracle he uttered to him being divinely inspired  and Peisistratos  having understood the oracle and having said that he accepted the prophecy which was uttered  led his army against the enemy. Now the Athenians from the city were just at that time occupied with the morning meal  and some of them after their meal with games of dice or with sleep; and the forces of Peisistratos fell upon the Athenians and put them to flight. Then as they fled  Peisistratos devised a very skilful counsel  to the end that the Athenians might not gather again into one body but might remain scattered abroad. He mounted his sons on horseback and sent them before him; and overtaking the fugitives they said that which was commanded them by Peisistratos  bidding them be of good cheer and that each man should depart to his own home.,mashup

Thus then the Athenians did  and so Peisistratos for the third time obtained possession of Athens  and he firmly rooted his despotism by many foreign mercenaries and by much revenue of money  coming partly from the land itself and partly from about the river Strymon  and also by taking as hostages the sons of those Athenians who had remained in the land and had not at once fled  and placing them in the hands of Naxos; for this also Peisistratos conquered by war and delivered into the charge of Lygdamis. Moreover besides this he cleansed the island of Delos in obedience to the oracles; and his cleansing was of the following kind:— so far as the view from the temple extended he dug up all the dead bodies which were buried in this part and removed them to another part of Delos. So Peisistratos was despot of the Athenians; but of the Athenians some had fallen in the battle  and others of them with the sons of Alcmaion were exiles from their native land.,mashup

Such was the condition of things which Croesus heard was prevailing among the Athenians during this time; but as to the Lacedemonians he heard that they had escaped from great evils and had now got the better of the Tegeans in the war. For when Leon and Hegesicles were kings of Sparta  the Lacedemonians  who had good success in all their other wars  suffered disaster in that alone which they waged against the men of Tegea. Moreover in the times before this they had the worst laws of almost all the Hellenes  both in matters which concerned themselves alone and also in that they had no dealings with strangers. And they made their change to a good constitution of laws thus:— Lycurgos  a man of the Spartans who was held in high repute  came to the Oracle at Delphi  and as he entered the sanctuary of the temple  straightway the Pythian prophetess said as follows:Lo  thou art come  O Lycurgos  to this rich shrine of my temple  Loved thou by Zeus and by all who possess the abodes of Olympos. Whether to call thee a god  I doubt  in my voices prophetic  God or a man  but rather a god I think  O Lycurgos. Some say in addition to this that the Pythian prophetess also set forth to him the order of things which is now established for the Spartans; but the Lacedemonians themselves say that Lycurgos having become guardian of Leobotes his brother's son  who was king of the Spartans  brought in these things from Crete. For as soon as he became guardian  he changed all the prevailing laws  and took measures that they should not transgress his institutions: and after this Lycurgos established that which appertained to war  namely  Enomoties  and  Triecads  and Common Meals  and in addition to this the Ephors and the Senate.,mashup

Having changed thus  the Spartans had good laws; and to Lycurgos after he was dead they erected a temple  and they pay him great worship. So then  as might be supposed  with a fertile land and with no small number of men dwelling in it  they straightway shot up and became prosperous: and it was no longer sufficient for them to keep still; but presuming that they were superior in strength to the Arcadians  they consulted the Oracle at Delphi respecting conquest of the whole of Arcadia; and the Pythian prophetess gave answer thus:The land of Arcadia thou askest; thou askest me much; I refuse it; Many there are in Arcadian land  stout men  eating acorns; These will prevent thee from this: but I am not grudging towards thee; Tegea beaten with sounding feet I will give thee to dance in  And a fair plain I will give thee to measure with line and divide it. When the Lacedemonians heard report of this  they held off from the other Arcadians  and marched against the Tegeans with fetters in their hands  trusting to a deceitful oracle and expecting that they would make slaves of the men of Tegea. But having been worsted in the encounter  those of them who were taken alive worked wearing the fetters which they themselves brought with them and havingmeasured with line and divided the plain of the Tegeans. And these fetters with which they had been bound were preserved even to my own time at Tegea  hanging about the temple of Athene Alea.,mashup

In the former war then I say they struggled against the Tegeans continually with ill success; but in the time of Croesus and in the reign of Anaxandrides and Ariston at Lacedemon the Spartans had at length become victors in the war; and they became so in the following manner:— As they continued to be always worsted in the war by the men of Tegea  they sent messengers to consult the Oracle at Delphi and inquired what god they should propitiate in order to get the better of the men of Tegea in the war: and the Pythian prophetess made answer to them that they should bring into their land the bones of Orestes the son of Agamemnon. Then as they were not able to find the grave of Orestes  they sent men again to go to the god and to inquire about the spot where Orestes was laid: and when the messengers who were sent asked this  the prophetess said as follows:Tegea there is  in Arcadian land  in a smooth place founded; Where there do blow two blasts by strong compulsion together; Stroke too there is and stroke in return  and trouble on trouble. There Agamemnon's son in the life-giving earth is reposing; Him if thou bring with thee home  of Tegea thou shalt be master. When the Lacedemonians had heard this they were none the less far from finding it out  though they searched all places; until the time that Lichas  one of those Spartans who are calledWell-doers  discovered it.

Lichas then  being one of these  discovered it in Tegea by means both of fortune and ability. For as there were at that time dealings under truce with the men of Tegea  he had come to a forge there and was looking at iron being wrought; and he was in wonder as he saw that which was being done. The smith therefore  perceiving that he marvelled at it  ceased from his work and said:Surely  thou stranger of Lacedemon  if thou hadst seen that which I once saw  thou wouldst have marvelled much  since now it falls out that thou dost marvel so greatly at the working of this iron; for I  desiring in this enclosure to make a well  lighted in my digging upon a coffin of seven cubits in length; and not believing that ever there had been men larger than those of the present day  I opened it  and I saw that the dead body was equal in length to the coffin: then after I had measured it  I filled in the earth over it again. He then thus told him of that which he had seen; and the other  having thought upon that which was told  conjectured that this was Orestes according to the saying of the Oracle  forming his conjecture in the following manner:— whereas he saw that the smith had two pairs of bellows  he concluded that these were the winds spoken of  and that the anvil and the hammer were the stroke and the stroke in return  and that the iron which was being wrought was the trouble laid upon trouble  making comparison by the thought that iron has been discovered for the evil of mankind. Having thus conjectured he came back to Sparta and declared the whole matter to the Lacedemonians; and they brought a charge against him on a fictitious pretext and drove him out into exile. So having come to Tegea  he told the smith of his evil fortune and endeavoured to hire from him the enclosure  but at first he would not allow him to have it: at length however Lichas persuaded him and he took up his abode there; and he dug up the grave and gathered together the bones and went with them away to Sparta. From that time  whenever they made trial of one another  the Lacedemonians had much the advantage in the war; and by now they had subdued to themselves the greater part of Peloponnesus besides.,mashup

Croesus accordingly being informed of all these things was sending messengers to Sparta with gifts in their hands to ask for an alliance  having commanded them what they ought to say: and they when they came said:Croesus king of the Lydians and also of other nations sent us hither and saith as follows: O Lacedemonians  whereas the god by an oracle bade me join with myself the Hellene as a friend  therefore  since I am informed that ye are the chiefs of Hellas  I invite you according to the oracle  desiring to be your friend and your ally apart from all guile and deceit. Thus did Croesus announce to the Lacedemonians through his messengers; and the Lacedemonians  who themselves also had heard of the oracle given to Croesus  were pleased at the coming of the Lydians and exchanged oaths of friendship and alliance: for they were bound to Croesus also by some services rendered to them even before this time; since the Lacedemonians had sent to Sardis and were buying gold there with purpose of using it for the image of Apollo which is now set up on Mount Thornax in the Lacedemonian land; and Croesus  when they desired to buy it  gave it them as a gift.,mashup

For this reason therefore the Lacedemonians accepted the alliance  and also because he chose them as his friends  preferring them to all the other Hellenes. And not only were they ready themselves when he made his offer  but they caused a mixing-bowl to be made of bronze  covered outside with figures round the rim and of such a size as to hold three hundred amphors  and this they conveyed  desiring to give it as a gift in return to Croesus. This bowl never came to Sardis for reasons of which two accounts are given as follows:— The Lacedemonians say that when the bowl was on its way to Sardis and came opposite the land of Samos  the men of Samos having heard of it sailed out with ships of war and took it away; but the Samians themselves say that the Lacedemonians who were conveying the bowl  finding that they were too late and hearing that Sardis had been taken and Croesus was a prisoner  sold the bowl in Samos  and certain private persons bought it and dedicated it as a votive offering in the temple of Hera; and probably those who had sold it would say when they returned to Sparta that it had been taken from them by the Samians.,mashup

Thus then it happened about the mixing-bowl: but meanwhile Croesus  mistaking the meaning of the oracle  was making a march into Cappadokia  expecting to overthrow Cyrus and the power of the Persians: and while Croesus was preparing to march against the Persians  one of the Lydians  who even before this time was thought to be a wise man but in consequence of this opinion got a very great name for wisdom among the Lydians  had advised Croesus as follows (the name of the man was Sandanis ):—O king  thou art preparing to march against men who wear breeches of leather  and the rest of their clothing is of leather also; and they eat food not such as they desire but such as they can obtain  dwelling in a land which is rugged; and moreover they make no use of wine but drink water; and no figs have they for dessert  nor any other good thing. On the one hand  if thou shalt overcome them  what wilt thou take away from them  seeing they have nothing? and on the other hand  if thou shalt be overcome  consider how many good things thou wilt lose; for once having tasted our good things  they will cling to them fast and it will not be possible to drive them away. I for my own part feel gratitude to the gods that they do not put it into the minds of the Persians to march against the Lydians. Thus he spoke not persuading Croesus: for it is true indeed that the Persians before they subdued the Lydians had no luxury nor any good thing.,mashup

Now the Cappadokians are called by the Hellenes Syrians; and these Syrians  before the Persians had rule  were subjects of the Medes  but at this time they were subjects of Cyrus. For the boundary between the Median empire and the Lydian was the river Halys; and this flows from the mountain-land of Armenia through the Kilikians  and afterwards  as it flows  it has the Matienians on the right hand and the Phrygians on the other side; then passing by these and flowing up towards the North Wind  it bounds on the one side the Cappadokian Syrians and on the left hand the Paphlagonians. Thus the river Halys cuts off from the rest almost all the lower parts of Asia by a line extending from the sea that is opposite Cyprus to the Euxine. And this tract is the neck of the whole peninsula  the distance of the journey being such that five days are spent on the way by a man without encumbrance.,mashup

Now for the following reasons Croesus was marching into Cappadokia:— first because he desired to acquire the land in addition to his own possessions  and then especially because he had confidence in the oracle and wished to take vengeance on Cyrus for Astyages. For Cyrus the son of Cambyses had conquered Astyages and was keeping him in captivity  who was brother by marriage to Croesus and king of the Medes: and he had become the brother by marriage of Croesus in this manner:— A horde of the nomad Scythians at feud with the rest withdrew and sought refuge in the land of the Medes: and at this time the ruler of the Medes was Kyaxares the son of Phraortes  the son of Deiokes  who at first dealt well with these Scythians  being suppliants for his protection; and esteeming them very highly he delivered boys to them to learn their speech and the art of shooting with the bow. Then time went by  and the Scythians used to go out continually to the chase and always brought back something; till once it happened that they took nothing  and when they returned with empty hands Kyaxares (being  as he showed on this occasion  not of an eminently good disposition ) dealt with them very harshly and used insult towards them. And they  when they had received this treatment from Kyaxares  considering that they had suffered indignity  planned to kill and to cut up one of the boys who were being instructed among them  and having dressed his flesh as they had been wont to dress the wild animals  to bear it to Kyaxares and give it to him  pretending that it was game taken in hunting; and when they had given it  their design was to make their way as quickly as possible to Alyattes the son of Sadyattes at Sardis. This then was done; and Kyaxares with the guests who ate at his table tasted of that meat  and the Scythians having so done became suppliants for the protection of Alyattes.,mashup

And this change of the day Thales the Milesian had foretold to the Ionians laying down as a limit this very year in which the change took place. The Lydians however and the Medes  when they saw that it had become night instead of day  ceased from their fighting and were much more eager both of them that peace should be made between them. And they who brought about the peace between them were Syennesis the Kilikian and Labynetos the Babylonian: these were they who urged also the taking of the oath by them  and they brought about an interchange of marriages; for they decided that Alyattes should give his daughter Aryenis to Astyages the son of Kyaxares  seeing that without the compulsion of a strong tie agreements are apt not to hold strongly together. Now these nations observe the same ceremonies in taking oaths as the Hellenes  and in addition to them they make incision into the skin of their arms  and then lick up the blood each of the other.,mashup

This then was the complaint which Croesus had against Cyrus when he sent to the Oracles to ask if he should march against the Persians; and when a deceitful answer had come back to him  he marched into the dominion of the Persians  supposing that the answer was favourable to himself. And when Croesus came to the river Halys  then  according to my account  he passed his army across by the bridges which there were; but  according to the account which prevails among the Hellenes  Thales the Milesian enabled him to pass his army across. For  say they  when Croesus was at a loss how his army should pass over the river (since  they add  there were not yet at that time the bridges which now there are )  Thales being present in the army caused the river  which flowed then on the left hand of the army  to flow partly also on the right; and he did it thus:— beginning above the camp he proceeded to dig a deep channel  directing it in the form of a crescent moon  so that the river might take the camp there pitched in the rear  being turned aside from its ancient course by this way along the channel  and afterwards passing by the camp might fall again into its ancient course; so that as soon as the river was thus parted in two it became fordable by both branches: and some say even that the ancient course of the river was altogether dried up. But this tale I do not admit as true  for how then did they pass over the river as they went back?,mashup

And Croesus  when he had passed over with his army  came to that place in Cappadokia which is called Pteria (now Pteria is the strongest place in this country  and is situated somewhere about in a line with the city of Sinope on the Euxine ). Here he encamped and ravaged the fields of the Syrians. Moreover he took the city of the Pterians  and sold the people into slavery  and he took also all the towns that lay about it; and the Syrians  who were not guilty of any wrong  he forced to remove from their homes. Meanwhile Cyrus  having gathered his own forces and having taken up in addition to them all who dwelt in the region between  was coming to meet Croesus. Before he began however to lead forth his army  he had sent heralds to the Ionians and tried to induce them to revolt from Croesus; but the Ionians would not do as he said. Then when Cyrus was come and had encamped over against Croesus  they made trial of one another by force of arms in the land of Pteria: and after hard fighting  when many had fallen on both sides  at length  night having come on  they parted from one the other with no victory on either side.,mashup

Thus the two armies contended with one another: and Croesus being ill satisfied with his own army in respect of number (for the army which he had when he fought was far smaller than that of Cyrus )  being dissatisfied with it I say on this account  as Cyrus did not attempt to advance against him on the following day  marched back to Sardis  having it in his mind to call the Egyptians to his help according to the oath which they had taken (for he had made an alliance with Amasis king of Egypt before he made the alliance with the Lacedemonians )  and to summon the Babylonians as well (for with these also an alliance had been concluded by him  Labynetos being at that time ruler of the Babylonians )  and moreover to send a message to the Lacedemonians bidding them appear at a fixed time: and then after he had got all these together and had gathered his own army  his design was to let the winter go by and at the coming of spring to march against the Persians. So with these thoughts in his mind  as soon as he came to Sardis he proceeded to send heralds to his several allies to give them notice that by the fifth month from that time they should assemble at Sardis: but the army which he had with him and which had fought with the Persians  an army which consisted of mercenary troops  he let go and disbanded altogether  never expecting that Cyrus  after having contended against him with such even fortune  would after all march upon Sardis.,mashup

When Croesus had these plans in his mind  the suburb of the city became of a sudden all full of serpents; and when these had appeared  the horses leaving off to feed in their pastures came constantly thither and devoured them. When Croesus saw this he deemed it to be a portent  as indeed it was: and forthwith he despatched messengers to the dwelling of the Telmessians  who interpret omens: and the messengers who were sent to consult arrived there and learnt from the Telmessians what the portent meant to signify  but they did not succeed in reporting the answer to Croesus  for before they sailed back to Sardis Croesus had been taken prisoner. The Telmessians however gave decision thus: that an army speaking a foreign tongue was to be looked for by Croesus to invade his land  and that this when it came would subdue the native inhabitants; for they said that the serpent was born of the soil  while the horse was an enemy and a stranger. The men of Telmessos thus made answer to Croesus after he was already taken prisoner  not knowing as yet anything of the things which had happened to Sardis and to Croesus himself.,mashup

Cyrus  however  so soon as Croesus marched away after the battle which had been fought in Pteria  having learnt that Croesus meant after he had marched away to disband his army  took counsel with himself and concluded that it was good for him to march as quickly as possible to Sardis  before the power of the Lydians should be again gathered together. So when he had resolved upon this  he did it without delay: for he marched his army into Lydia with such speed that he was himself the first to announce his coming to Croesus. Then Croesus  although he had come to a great strait  since his affairs had fallen out altogether contrary to his own expectation  yet proceeded to lead forth the Lydians into battle. Now there was at this time no nation in Asia more courageous or more stout in battle than the Lydian; and they fought on horseback carrying long spears  the men being excellent in horsemanship.,mashup

Then when all his men had been placed in their several positions  he charged them to spare none of the other Lydians  slaying all who might come in their way  but Croesus himself they were not to slay  not even if he should make resistance when he was captured. Such was his charge: and he set the camels opposite the horsemen for this reason — because the horse has a fear of the camel and cannot endure either to see his form or to scent his smell: for this reason then the trick had been devised  in order that the cavalry of Croesus might be useless  that very force wherewith the Lydian king was expecting most to shine. And as they were coming together to the battle  so soon as the horses scented the camels and saw them they turned away back  and the hopes of Croesus were at once brought to nought. The Lydians however for their part did not upon that act as cowards  but when they perceived what was coming to pass they leapt from their horses and fought with the Persians on foot. At length  however  when many had fallen on either side  the Lydians turned to flight; and having been driven within the wall of their fortress they were besieged by the Persians.,mashup

By these then a siege had been established: but Croesus  supposing that the siege would last a long time  proceeded to send from the fortress other messengers to his allies. For the former messengers were sent round to give notice that they should assemble at Sardis by the fifth month  but these he was sending out to ask them to come to his assistance as quickly as possible  because Croesus was being besieged.,mashup

So then in sending to his other allies he sent also to Lacedemon. But these too  the Spartans I mean  had themselves at this very time (for so it had fallen out ) a quarrel in hand with the Argives about the district called Thyrea. For this Thyrea  being part of the Argive possessions  the Lacedemonians had cut off and taken for themselves. Now the whole region towards the west extending as far down as Malea was then possessed by the Argives  both the parts situated on the mainland and also the island of Kythera with the other islands. And when the Argives had come to the rescue to save their territory from being cut off from them  then the two sides came to a parley together and agreed that three hundred should fight of each side  and whichever side had the better in the fight that nation should possess the disputed land: they agreed moreover that the main body of each army should withdraw to their own country  and not stand by while the contest was fought  for fear lest  if the armies were present  one side seeing their countrymen suffering defeat should come up to their support. Having made this agreement they withdrew; and chosen men of both sides were left behind and engaged in fight with one another. So they fought and proved themselves to be equally matched; and there were left at last of six hundred men three  on the side of the Argives Alkenor and Chromios  and on the side of the Lacedemonians Othryades: these were left alive when night came on. So then the two men of the Argives  supposing that they were the victors  set off to run to Argos  but the Lacedemonian Othryades  after having stripped the corpses of the Argives and carried their arms to his own camp  remained in his place. On the next day both the two sides came thither to inquire about the result; and for some time both claimed the victory for themselves  the one side saying that of them more had remained alive  and the others declaring that these had fled away  whereas their own man had stood his ground and had stripped the corpses of the other party: and at length by reason of this dispute they fell upon one another and began to fight; and after many had fallen on both sides  the Lacedemonians were the victors. The Argives then cut their hair short  whereas formerly they were compelled by law to wear it long  and they made a law with a curse attached to it  that from that time forth no man of the Argives should grow the hair long nor their women wear ornaments of gold  until they should have won back Thyrea. The Lacedemonians however laid down for themselves the opposite law to this  namely that they should wear long hair from that time forward  whereas before that time they had not their hair long. And they say that the one man who was left alive of the three hundred  namely Othryades  being ashamed to return to Sparta when all his comrades had been slain  slew himself there in Thyrea.,mashup

Now the taking of Sardis came about as follows:— When the fourteenth day came after Croesus began to be besieged  Cyrus made proclamation to his army  sending horsemen round to the several parts of it  that he would give gifts to the man who should first scale the wall. After this the army made an attempt; and when it failed  then after all the rest had ceased from the attack  a certain Mardian whose name was Hyroiades made an attempt to approach on that side of the citadel where no guard had been set; for they had no fear that it would ever be taken from that side  seeing that here the citadel is precipitous and unassailable. To this part of the wall alone Meles also  who formerly was king of Sardis  did not carry round the lion which his concubine bore to him  the Telmessians having given decision that if the lion should be carried round the wall  Sardis should be safe from capture: and Meles having carried it round the rest of the wall  that is to say those parts of the citadel where the fortress was open to attack  passed over this part as being unassailable and precipitous: now this is a part of the city which is turned towards Tmolos. So then this Mardian Hyroiades  having seen on the day before how one of the Lydians had descended on that side of the citadel to recover his helmet which had rolled down from above  and had picked it up  took thought and cast the matter about in his own mind.

Now in his former time of prosperity Croesus had done everything that was possible for him  and besides other things which he devised he had also sent messengers to Delphi to inquire concerning him. And the Pythian prophetess spoke to him thus:Lydian  master of many  much blind to destiny  Croesus  Do not desire to hear in thy halls that voice which is prayed for  Voice of thy son; much better if this from thee were remov�d  Since he shall first utter speech in an evil day of misfortune. Now when the fortress was being taken  one of the Persians was about to slay Croesus taking him for another; and Croesus for his part  seeing him coming on  cared nothing for it because of the misfortune which was upon him  and to him it was indifferent that he should be slain by the stroke; but this voiceless son  when he saw the Persian coming on  by reason of terror and affliction burst the bonds of his utterance and said:Man  slay not Croesus. This son  I say  uttered voice then first of all  but after this he continued to use speech for the whole time of his life.,mashup

The Persians then had obtained possession of Sardis and had taken Croesus himself prisoner  after he had reigned fourteen years and had been besieged fourteen days  having fulfilled the oracle in that he had brought to an end his own great empire. So the Persians having taken him brought him into the presence of Cyrus: and he piled up a great pyre and caused Croesus to go up upon it bound in fetters  and along with him twice seven sons of Lydians  whether it was that he meant to dedicate this offering as first-fruits of his victory to some god  or whether he desired to fulfil a vow  or else had heard that Croesus was a god-fearing man and so caused him to go up on the pyre because he wished to know if any one of the divine powers would save him  so that he should not be burnt alive. He  they say  did this; but to Croesus as he stood upon the pyre there came  although he was in such evil case  a memory of the saying of Solon  how he had said with divine inspiration that no one of the living might be called happy. And when this thought came into his mind  they say that he sighed deeply and groaned aloud  having been for long silent  and three times he uttered the name of Solon. Hearing this  Cyrus bade the interpreters ask Croesus who was this person on whom he called; and they came near and asked. And Croesus for a time  it is said  kept silence when he was asked this  but afterwards being pressed he said:One whom more than much wealth I should have desired to have speech with all monarchs. Then  since his words were of doubtful import  they asked again of that which he said; and as they were urgent with him and gave him no peace  he told how once Solon an Athenian had come  and having inspected all his wealth had made light of it  with such and such words; and how all had turned out for him according as Solon had said  not speaking at all especially with a view to Croesus himself  but with a view to the whole human race and especially those who seem to themselves to be happy men. And while Croesus related these things  already the pyre was lighted and the edges of it round about were burning. Then they say that Cyrus  hearing from the interpreters what Croesus had said  changed his purpose and considered that he himself also was but a man  and that he was delivering another man  who had been not inferior to himself in felicity  alive to the fire; and moreover he feared the requital  and reflected that there was nothing of that which men possessed which was secure; therefore  they say  he ordered them to extinguish as quickly as possible the fire that was burning  and to bring down Croesus and those who were with him from the pyre; and they using endeavours were not able now to get the mastery of the flames.,mashup

Then it is related by the Lydians that Croesus  having learned how Cyrus had changed his mind  and seeing that every one was trying to put out the fire but that they were no longer able to check it  cried aloud entreating Apollo that if any gift had ever been given by him which had been acceptable to the god  he would come to his aid and rescue him from the evil which was now upon him. So he with tears entreated the god  and suddenly  they say  after clear sky and calm weather clouds gathered and a storm burst  and it rained with a very violent shower  and the pyre was extinguished. Then Cyrus  having perceived that Croesus was a lover of the gods and a good man  caused him to be brought down from the pyre and asked him as follows:Croesus  tell me who of all men was it who persuaded thee to march upon my land and so to become an enemy to me instead of a friend ? and he said:O king  I did this to thy felicity and to my own misfortune  and the causer of this was the god of the Hellenes  who incited me to march with my army. For no one is so senseless as to choose of his own will war rather peace  since in peace the sons bury their fathers  but in war the fathers bury their sons. But it was pleasing  I suppose  to the divine powers that these things should come to pass thus.,mashup

So he spoke  and Cyrus loosed his bonds and caused him to sit near himself and paid to him much regard  and he marvelled both himself and all who were about him at the sight of Croesus. And Croesus wrapt in thought was silent; but after a time  turning round and seeing the Persians plundering the city of the Lydians  he said:O king  must I say to thee that which I chance to have in my thought  or must I keep silent in this my present fortune ? Then Cyrus bade him say boldly whatsoever he desired; and he asked him saying:What is the business that this great multitude of men is doing with so much eagerness ? and he said:They are plundering thy city and carrying away thy wealth. And Croesus answered:Neither is it my city that they are plundering nor my wealth which they are carrying away; for I have no longer any property in these things: but it is thy wealth that they are carrying and driving away.,mashup

And Cyrus was concerned by that which Croesus had said  and he caused all the rest to withdraw and asked Croesus what he discerned for his advantage as regards that which was being done; and he said:Since the gods gave me to thee as a slave  I think it right if I discern anything more than others to signify it to thee. The Persians  who are by nature unruly  are without wealth: if therefore thou shalt suffer them to carry off in plunder great wealth and to take possession of it  then it is to be looked for that thou wilt experience this result  thou must expect namely that whosoever gets possession of the largest share will make insurrection against thee. Now therefore  if that which I say is pleasing to thee  do this:— set spearmen of thy guard to watch at all the gates  and let these take away the things  and say to the men who were bearing them out of the city that they must first be tithed for Zeus: and thus thou on the one hand wilt not be hated by them for taking away the things by force  and they on the other will willingly let the things go  acknowledging within themselves that thou art doing that which is just.,mashup

Hearing this  Cyrus was above measure pleased  because he thought that Croesus advised well; and he commended him much and enjoined the spearmen of his guard to perform that which Croesus had advised: and after that he spoke to Croesus thus:Croesus  since thou art prepared  like a king as thou art  to do good deeds and speak good words  therefore ask me for a gift  whatsoever thou desirest to be given thee forthwith. And he said:Master  thou wilt most do me a pleasure if thou wilt permit me to send to the god of the Hellenes  whom I honoured most of all gods  these fetters  and to ask him whether it is accounted by him right to deceive those who do well to him. Then Cyrus asked him what accusation he made against the god  that he thus requested; and Croesus repeated to him all that had been in his mind  and the answers of the Oracles  and especially the votive offerings  and how he had been incited by the prophecy to march upon the Persians: and thus speaking he came back again to the request that it might be permitted to him to make this reproach against the god. And Cyrus laughed and said:Not this only shalt thou obtain from me  Croesus  but also whatsoever thou mayst desire of me at any time. Hearing this Croesus sent certain of the Lydians to Delphi  enjoining them to lay the fetters upon the threshold of the temple and to ask the god whether he felt no shame that he had incited Croesus by his prophecies to march upon the Persians  persuading him that he should bring to an end the empire of Cyrus  seeing that these were the first- fruits of spoil which he had won from it — at the same time displaying the fetters. This they were to ask  and moreover also whether it was thought right by the gods of the Hellenes to practice ingratitude.,mashup

And Croesus paid the debt due for the sin of his fifth ancestor  who being one of the spearmen of the Heracleidai followed the treacherous device of a woman  and having slain his master took possession of his royal dignity  which belonged not to him of right. And although Loxias eagerly desired that the calamity of Sardis might come upon the sons of Croesus and not upon Croesus himself  it was not possible for him to draw the Destinies aside from their course; but so much as these granted he brought to pass  and gave it as a gift to Croesus: for he put off the taking of Sardis by three years; and let Croesus be assured that he was taken prisoner later by these years than the fated time: moreover secondly  he assisted him when he was about to be burnt. And as to the oracle which was given  Croesus finds fault with good ground: for Loxias told him beforehand that if he should march upon the Persians he should destroy a great empire: and he upon hearing this  if he wished to take counsel well  ought to have sent and asked further whether the god meant his own empire or that of Cyrus: but as he did not comprehend that which was uttered and did not ask again  let him pronounce himself to be the cause of that which followed. To him also when he consulted the Oracle for the last time Loxias said that which he said concerning a mule; but this also he failed to comprehend: for Cyrus was in fact this mule  seeing that he was born of parents who were of two different races  his mother being of nobler descent and his father of less noble: for she was a Median woman  daughter of Astyages and king of the Medes  but he was a Persian  one of a race subject to the Medes  and being inferior in all respects he was the husband of one who was his royal mistress. Thus the Pythian prophetess replied to the Lydians  and they brought the answer back to Sardis and repeated it to Croesus; and he  when he heard it  acknowledged that the fault was his own and not that of the god. With regard then to the empire of Croesus and the first conquest of Ionia  it happened thus.,mashup

Καὶ περὶ μὲν ἀναθημάτων τοσαῦτα εἰρήσθω Now there are in Hellas many other votive offerings made by Croesus and not only those which have been mentioned: for first at Thebes of the Boeotians there is a tripod of gold  which he dedicated to the Ismenian Apollo; then at Ephesos there are the golden cows and the greater number of the pillars of the temple; and in the temple of Athene Pronaia at Delphi a large golden shield. These were still remaining down to my own time  but others of his votive offerings have perished: and the votive offerings of Croesus at Branchidai of the Milesians were  as I am told  equal in weight and similar to those at Delphi. Now those which he sent to Delphi and to the temple of Amphiaraos he dedicated of his own goods and as first-fruits of the wealth inherited from his father; but the other offerings were made of the substance of a man who was his foe  who before Croesus became king had been factious against him and had joined in endeavouring to make Pantaleon ruler of the Lydians. Now Pantaleon was a son of Alyattes and a brother of Croesus  but not by the same mother  for Croesus was born to Alyattes of a Carian woman  but Pantaleon of an Ionian. And when Croesus had gained possession of the kingdom by the gift of his father  he put to death the man who opposed him  drawing him upon the carding-comb; and his property  which even before that time he had vowed to dedicate  he then offered in the manner mentioned to those shrines which have been named. About his votive offerings let it suffice to have said so much.,mashup

Of marvels to be recorded the land of Lydia has no great store as compared with other lands  excepting the gold-dust which is carried down from Tmolos; but one work it has to show which is larger far than any other except only those in Egypt and Babylon: for there is there the sepulchral monument of Alyattes the father of Croesus  of which the base is made of larger stones and the rest of the monument is of earth piled up. And this was built by contributions of those who practised trade and of the artisans and the girls who plied their traffic there; and still there existed to my own time boundary-stones five in number erected upon the monument above  on which were carved inscriptions telling how much of the work was done by each class; and upon measurement it was found that the work of the girls was the greatest in amount. For the daughters of the common people in Lydia practice prostitution one and all  to gather for themselves dowries  continuing this until the time when they marry; and the girls give themselves away in marriage. Now the circuit of the monument is six furlongs and two hundred feet  and the breadth is thirteen hundred feet. And adjoining the monument is a great lake  which the Lydians say has a never-failing supply of water  and it is called the lake of Gyges. Such is the nature of this monument.,mashup

Now the Lydians have very nearly the same customs as the Hellenes  with the exception that they prostitute their female children; and they were the first of men  so far as we know  who struck and used coin of gold or silver; and also they were the first retail-traders. And the Lydians themselves say that the games which are now in use among them and among the Hellenes were also their invention. These they say were invented among them at the same time as they colonised Tyrsenia  and this is the account they give of them:— In the reign of Atys the son of Manes their king there came to be a grievous dearth over the whole of Lydia; and the Lydians for a time continued to endure it  but afterwards  as it did not cease  they sought for remedies; and one devised one thing and another of them devised another thing. And then were discovered  they say  the ways of playing with the dice and the knucklebones and the ball  and all the other games excepting draughts (for the discovery of this last is not claimed by the Lydians ). These games they invented as a resource against the famine  and thus they used to do:— on one of the days they would play games all the time in order that they might not feel the want of food  and on the next they ceased from their games and had food: and thus they went on for eighteen years. As however the evil did not slacken but pressed upon them ever more and more  therefore their king divided the whole Lydian people into two parts  and he appointed by lot one part to remain and the other to go forth from the land; and the king appointed himself to be over that one of the parts which had the lot to stay in the land  and his son to be over that which was departing; and the name of his son was Tyrsenos. So the one party of them  having obtained the lot to go forth from the land  went down to the sea at Smyrna and built ships for themselves  wherein they placed all the movable goods which they had and sailed away to seek for means of living and a land to dwell in; until after passing by many nations they came at last to the land of the Ombricans  and there they founded cities and dwell up to the present time: and changing their name they were called after the king's son who led them out from home  not Lydians but Tyrsenians  taking the name from him. The Lydians then had been made subject to the Persians as I say:,mashup

Following then the report of some of the Persians — those I mean who do not desire to glorify the history of Cyrus but to speak that which is in fact true — according to their report  I say  I shall write; but I could set forth also the other forms of the story in three several ways. The Assyrians ruled Upper Asia for five hundred and twenty years  and from them the Medes were the first who made revolt. These having fought for their freedom with the Assyrians proved themselves good men  and thus they pushed off the yoke of slavery from themselves and were set free; and after them the other nations also did the same as the Medes: and when all on the continent were thus independent  they returned again to despotic rule as follows:,mashup

There appeared among the Medes a man of great ability whose name was Deiokes  and this man was the son of Phraortes. This Deiokes  having formed a desire for despotic power  did thus:— whereas the Medes dwelt in separate villages  he  being even before that time of great repute in his own village  set himself to practise just dealing much more and with greater zeal than before; and this he did although there was much lawlessness throughout the whole of Media  and although he knew that injustice is ever at feud with justice. And the Medes of the same village  seeing his manners  chose him for their judge. So he  since he was aiming at power  was upright and just  and doing thus he had no little praise from his fellow-citizens  insomuch that those of the other villages learning that Deiokes was a man who more than all others gave decision rightly  whereas before this they had been wont to suffer from unjust judgments  themselves also when they heard it came gladly to Deiokes to have their causes determined  and at last they trusted the business to no one else.,mashup

Ταῦτά κῃ λέγοντες πείθουσι ἑωυτοὺς βασιλεύεσθαι. Then  as more and more continually kept coming to him  because men learnt that his decisions proved to be according to the truth  Deiokes perceiving that everything was referred to himself would no longer sit in the place where he used formerly to sit in public to determine causes  and said that he would determine causes no more  for it was not profitable for him to neglect his own affairs and to determine causes for his neighbours all through the day. So then  since robbery and lawlessness prevailed even much more in the villages than they did before  the Medes having assembled together in one place considered with one another and spoke about the state in which they were: and I suppose the friends of Deiokes spoke much to this effect:Seeing that we are not able to dwell in the land under the present order of things  let us set up a king from among ourselves  and thus the land will be well governed and we ourselves shall turn to labour  and shall not be ruined by lawlessness. By some such words as these they persuaded themselves to have a king.,mashup

And when they straightway proposed the question whom they should set up to be king  Deiokes was much put forward and commended by every one  until at last they agreed that he should be their king. And he bade them build for him a palace worthy of the royal dignity and strengthen him with a guard of spearmen. And the Medes did so: for they built him a large and strong palace in that part of the land which he told them  and they allowed him to select spearmen from all the Medes. And when he had obtained the rule over them  he compelled the Medes to make one fortified city and pay chief attention to this  having less regard to the other cities. And as the Medes obeyed him in this also  he built large and strong walls  those which are now called Agbatana  standing in circles one within the other. And this wall is so contrived that one circle is higher than the next by the height of the battlements alone. And to some extent  I suppose  the nature of the ground  seeing that it is on a hill  assists towards this end; but much more was it produced by art  since the circles are in all seven in number. And within the last circle are the royal palace and the treasure-houses. The largest of these walls is in size about equal to the circuit of the wall round Athens; and of the first circle the battlements are white  of the second black  of the third crimson  of the fourth blue  of the fifth red: thus are the battlements of all the circles coloured with various tints  and the two last have their battlements one of them overlaid with silver and the other with gold.,mashup

These walls then Deiokes built for himself and round his own palace  and the people he commanded to dwell round about the wall. And after all was built  Deiokes established the rule  which he was the first to establish  ordaining that none should enter into the presence of the king  but that they deal with him always through messengers; and that the king should be seen by no one; and moreover that to laugh or to spit in presence is unseemly  and this last for every one without exception. Now he surrounded himself with this state to the end that his fellows  who had been brought up with him and were of no meaner family nor behind him in manly virtue  might not be grieved by seeing him and make plots against him  but that being unseen by them he might be thought to be of different mould.,mashup

When Phraortes had brought his life to an end  Kyaxares the son of Phraortes  the son of Deiokes  received the power. This king is said to have been yet much more warlike than his forefathers; and he first banded the men of Asia into separate divisions  that is to say  he first arrayed apart from one another the spearmen and the archers and the horsemen  for before that time they were all mingled together without distinction. This was he who fought with the Lydians when the day became night as they fought  and who also united under his rule the whole of Asia above the river Halys. And having gathered together all his subjects he marched upon Nineveh to avenge his father  and also because he desired to conquer that city. And when he had fought a battle with the Assyrians and had defeated them  while he was sitting down before Nineveh there came upon him a great army of Scythians  and the leader of them was Madyas the son of Protohyas  king of the Scythians. These had invaded Asia after driving the Kimmerians out of Europe  and in pursuit of them as they fled they had come to the land of Media.,mashup

However the Scythians did not make their invasion by this way  but turned aside from it to go by the upper road which is much longer  keeping Mount Caucasus on their right hand. Then the Medes fought with the Scythians  and having been worsted in the battle they lost their power  and the Scythians obtained rule over all Asia.,mashup

Now this temple  as I find by inquiry  is the most ancient of all the temples which belong to this goddess; for the temple in Cyprus was founded from this  as the people of Cyprus themselves report  and it was the Phenicians who founded the temple in Kythera  coming from this land of Syria. So these Scythians who had plundered the temple at Ascalon  and their descendants for ever  were smitten by the divinity with a disease which made them women instead of men: and the Scythians say that it was for this reason that they were diseased  and that for this reason travellers who visit Scythia now  see among them the affection of those who by the Scythians are called  Enareis.,mashup

For eight-and-twenty years then the Scythians were rulers of Asia  and by their unruliness and reckless behaviour everything was ruined; for on the one hand they exacted that in tribute from each people which they laid upon them  and apart from the tribute they rode about and carried off by force the possessions of each tribe. Then Kyaxares with the Medes  having invited the greater number of them to a banquet  made them drunk and slew them; and thus the Medes recovered their power  and had rule over the same nations as before; and they also took Nineveh — the manner how it was taken I shall set forth in another history — and made the Assyrians subject to them excepting only the land of Babylon.,mashup

After this Kyaxares died  having reigned forty years including those years during which the Scythians had rule  and Astyages son of Kyaxares received from him the kingdom. To him was born a daughter whom he named Mandane; and in his sleep it seemed to him that there passed from her so much water as to fill his city and also to flood the whole of Asia. This dream he delivered over to the Magian interpreters of dreams  and when he heard from them the truth at each point he became afraid. And afterwards when this Mandane was of an age to have a husband  he did not give her in marriage to any one of the Medes who were his peers  because he feared the vision; but he gave her to a Persian named Cambyses  whom he found to be of a good descent and of a quiet disposition  counting him to be in station much below a Mede of middle rank.,mashup

It seemed to him that from the womb of this daughter a vine grew  and this vine overspread the whole of Asia. Having seen this vision and delivered it to the interpreters of dreams  he sent for his daughter  being then with child  to come from the land of the Persians. And when she had come he kept watch over her  desiring to destroy that which should be born of her; for the Magian interpreters of dreams signified to him that the offspring of his daughter should be king in his room. Astyages then desiring to guard against this  when Cyrus was born  called Harpagos  a man who was of kin near him and whom he trusted above all the other Medes  and had made him manager of all his affairs; and to him he said as follows:Neglect not by any means  Harpagos  the matter which I shall lay upon thee to do  and beware lest thou set me aside  and choosing the advantage of others instead  bring thyself afterwards to destruction. Take the child which Mandane bore  and carry it to thy house and slay it; and afterwards bury it in whatsoever manner thou thyself desirest. To this he made answer:O king  never yet in any past time didst thou discern in me an offence against thee  and I keep watch over myself also with a view to the time that comes after  that I may not commit any error towards thee. If it is indeed thy pleasure that this should so be done  my service at least must be fitly rendered.,mashup

Thus he made answer  and when the child had been delivered to him adorned as for death  Harpagos went weeping to his wife all the words which had been spoken by Astyages. And she said to him:Now  therefore  what is it in thy mind to do ? and he made answer:Not according as Astyages enjoined: for not even if he shall come to be yet more out of his senses and more mad than he now is  will I agree to his will or serve him in such a murder as this. And for many reasons I will not slay the child; first because he is a kin to me  and then because Astyages is old and without male issue  and if after he is dead the power shall come through me  does not the greatest of dangers then await me?

Thus he spoke  and straightway sent a messenger to that one of the herdsmen of Astyages who he knew fed his herds on the pastures which were most suitable for his purpose  and on the mountains most haunted by wild beasts. The name of this man was Mitradates  and he was married to one who was his fellow-slave; and the name of the woman to whom he was married was Kyno in the tongue of the Hellenes and in the Median tongue Spaco  for what the Hellenes call  kyna  (bitch ) the Medes call  spaca. Now  it was on the skirts of the mountains that this herdsman had his cattle-pastures  from Agbatana towards the North Wind and towards the Euxine Sea. For here in the direction of the Saspeirians the Median land is very mountainous and lofty and thickly covered with forests; but the rest of the land of Media is all level plain. So when this herdsman came  being summoned with much urgency  Harpagos said these words:Astyages bids thee take this child and place it on the most desolate part of the mountains  so that it may perish as quickly as possible. And he bade me to say that if thou do not kill it  but in any way shalt preserve it from death  he will slay thee by the most evil kind of destruction: and I have been appointed to see that the child is laid forth.,mashup

And his wife also  as it seems  having been every day on the point of bearing a child  by a providential chance brought her child to birth just at that time  when the herdsman was gone to the city. And both were in anxiety  each for the other  the man having fear about the child-bearing of his wife  and the woman about the cause why Harpagos had sent to summon her husband  not having been wont to do so aforetime. So as soon as he returned and stood before her  the woman seeing him again beyond her hopes was the first to speak  and asked him for what purpose Harpagos had sent for him so urgently. And he said:Wife  when I came to the city I saw and heard that which I would I had not seen  and which I should wish had never chanced to those whom we serve. For the house of Harpagos was all full of mourning  and I being astonished thereat went within: and as soon as I entered I saw laid out to view an infant child gasping for breath and screaming  which was adorned with gold ornaments and embroidered clothing: and when Harpagos saw me he bade me forthwith to take up the child and carry it away and lay it on that part of the mountains which is most haunted by wild beasts  saying that it was Astyages who laid this task upon me  and using to me many threats  if I should fail to do this. And I took it up and bore it away  supposing that it was the child of some one of the servants of the house  for never could I have supposed whence it really was; but I marvelled to see it adorned with gold and raiment  and I marvelled also because mourning was made for it openly in the house of Harpagos. And straightway as we went by the road  I learnt the whole of the matter from the servant who went with me out of the city and placed in my hands the babe  namely that it was in truth the son of Mandane the daughter of Astyages  and of Cambyses the son of Cyrus  and that Astyages bade slay it. And now here it is.,mashup

And as he said this the herdsman uncovered it and showed it to her. And she  seeing that the child was large and of fair form  wept and clung to the knees of her husband  beseeching him by no means to lay it forth. But he said that he could not do otherwise than so  for watchers would come backwards and forwards sent by Harpagos to see that this was done  and he would perish by a miserable death if he should fail to do this. And as she could not after all persuade her husband  the wife next said as follows:Since then I am unable to persuade thee not to lay it forth  do thou this which I shall tell thee  if indeed it needs must be seen laid forth. I also have borne a child  but I have borne it dead. Take this and expose it  and let us rear the child of the daughter of Astyages as if it were our own.

The child which he was bearing to put to death  this he delivered to his wife  and his own  which was dead  he took and placed in the chest in which he had been bearing the other; and having adorned it with all the adornment of the other child  he bore it to the most desolate part of the mountains and placed it there. And when the third day came after the child had been laid forth  the herdsman went to the city  leaving one of his under- herdsmen to watch there  and when he came to the house of Harpagos he said that he was ready to display the dead body of the child; and Harpagos sent the most trusted of his spearmen  and through them he saw and buried the herdsman's child. This then had had burial  but him who was afterwards called Cyrus the wife of the herdsman had received  and was bringing him up  giving him no doubt some other name  not Cyrus.,mashup

And when the boy was ten years old  it happened with regard to him as follows  and this made him known. He was playing in the village in which were stalls for oxen  he was playing there  I say  with other boys of his age in the road. And the boys in their play chose as their king this one who was called the son of the herdsman: and he set some of them to build palaces and others to be spearmen of his guard  and one of them no doubt he appointed to be the eye of the king  and to one he gave the office of bearing the messages  appointing a work for each one severally. Now one of these boys who was playing with the rest  the son of Artembares a man of repute among the Medes  did not do that which Cyrus appointed him to do; therefore Cyrus bade the other boys seize him hand and foot  and when they obeyed his command he dealt with the boy very roughly  scourging him. But he  so soon as he was let go  being made much more angry because he considered that he had been treated with indignity  went down to the city and complained to his father of the treatment which he had met with from Cyrus  calling him not Cyrus  for this was not yet his name  but the son of the herdsman of Astyages. And Artembares in the anger of the moment went at once to Astyages  taking the boy with him  and he declared that he had suffered things that were unfitting and said:O king  by thy slave  the son of a herdsman  we have been thus outraged  showing him the shoulders of his son.,mashup

And Astyages having heard and seen this  wishing to punish the boy to avenge the honour of Artembares  sent for both the herdsman and his son. And when both were present  Astyages looked at Cyrus and said:Didst thou dare  being the son of so mean a father as this  to treat with such unseemly insult the son of this man who is first in my favour ? And he replied thus:Master  I did so to him with right. For the boys of the village  of whom he also was one  in their play set me up as king over them  for I appeared to them most fitted for this place. Now the other boys did what I commanded them  but this one disobeyed and paid no regard  until at last he received the punishment due. If therefore for this I am worthy to suffer any evil  here I stand before thee.,mashup

While the boy thus spoke  there came upon Astyages a sense of recognition of him and the lineaments of his face seemed to him to resemble his own  and his answer appeared to be somewhat over free for his station  while the time of the laying forth seemed to agree with the age of the boy. Being struck with amazement by these things  for a time he was speechless; and having at length with difficulty recovered himself  he said  desiring to dismiss Artembares  in order that he might get the herdsman by himself alone and examine him:Artembares  I will so order these things that thou and thy son shall have no cause to find fault; and so he dismissed Artembares  and the servants upon the command of Astyages led Cyrus within. And when the herdsman was left alone with the king  Astyages being alone with him asked whence he had received the boy  and who it was who had delivered the boy to him. And the herdsman said that he was his own son  and that the mother was living with him still as his wife. But Astyages said that he was not well advised in desiring to be brought to extreme necessity  and as he said this he made a sign to the spearmen of his guard to seize him. So he  as he was being led away to the torture  then declared the story as it really was; and beginning from the beginning he went through the whole  telling the truth about it  and finally ended with entreaties  asking that he would grant him pardon.,mashup

So when the herdsman had made known the truth  Astyages now cared less about him  but with Harpagos he was very greatly displeased and bade his spearmen summon him. And when Harpagos came  Astyages asked him thus:By what death  Harpagos  didst thou destroy the child whom I delivered to thee  born of my daughter ? and Harpagos  seeing that the herdsman was in the king's palace  turned not to any false way of speech  lest he should be convicted and found out  but said as follows:O king  so soon as I received the child  I took counsel and considered how I should do according to thy mind  and how without offence to thy command I might not be guilty of murder against thy daughter and against thyself. I did therefore thus:— I called this herdsman and delivered the child to him  saying first that thou wert he who bade him slay it— and in this at least I did not lie  for thou didst so command. I delivered it  I say  to this man commanding him to place it upon a desolate mountain  and to stay by it and watch it until it should die  threatening him with all kinds of punishment if he should fail to accomplish this. And when he had done that which was ordered and the child was dead  I sent the most trusted of my eunuchs and through them I saw and buried the child. Thus  O king  it happened about this matter  and the child had this death which I say.,mashup

So Harpagos declared the truth  and Astyages concealed the anger which he kept against him for that which had come to pass  and first he related the matter over again to Harpagos according as he had been told it by the herdsman  and afterwards  when it had been thus repeated by him  he ended by saying that the child was alive and that that which had come to pass was well for  continued he I was greatly troubled by that which had been done to this child  and I thought it no light thing that I had been made at variance with my daughter.

And having entered it straightway  he sent forth his son  for he had one only son of about thirteen years old  bidding him go to the palace of Astyages and do whatsoever the king should command; and he himself being overjoyed told his wife that which had befallen him. But Astyages  when the son of Harpagos arrived  cut his throat and divided him limb from limb  and having roasted some pieces of the flesh and boiled others he caused them to be dressed for eating and kept them ready. And when the time arrived for dinner and the other guests were present and also Harpagos  then before the other guests and before Astyages himself were placed tables covered with flesh of sheep; but before Harpagos was placed the flesh of his own son  all but the head and the hands and the feet  and these were laid aside covered up in a basket. Then when it seemed that Harpagos was satisfied with food  Astyages asked him whether he had been pleased with the banquet; and when Harpagos said that he had been very greatly pleased  they who had been commanded to do this brought to him the head of his son covered up  together with the hands and the feet; and standing near they bade Harpagos uncover and take of them that which he desired. So when Harpagos obeyed and uncovered  he saw the remains of his son; and seeing them he was not overcome with amazement but contained himself: and Astyages asked him whether he perceived of what animal he had been eating the flesh: and he said that he perceived  and that whatsoever the king might do was well pleasing to him. Thus having made answer and taking up the parts of the flesh which still remained he went to his house; and after that  I suppose  he would gather all the parts together and bury them.,mashup

On Harpagos Astyages laid this penalty; and about Cyrus he took thought  and summoned the same men of the Magians who had given judgment about his dream in the manner which has been said: and when they came  Astyages asked how they had given judgment about his vision; and they spoke according to the same manner  saying that the child must have become king if he had lived on and had not died before. He made answer to them thus:The child is alive and not dead: and while he was dwelling in the country  the boys of the village appointed him king; and he performed completely all those things which they do who are really kings; for he exercised rule  appointed to their places spearmen of the guard and doorkeepers and bearers of messages and all else. Now therefore  to what does it seem to you that these things tend ? The Magians said:If the child is still alive and became king without any arrangement  be thou confident concerning him and have good courage  for he shall not be ruler again the second time; since some even of our oracles have had but small results  and that at least which has to do with dreams comes often in the end to a feeble accomplishment. Astyages made answer in these words:I myself also  O Magians  am most disposed to believe that this is so  namely that since the boy was named king the dream has had its fulfilment and that this boy is no longer a source of danger to me. Nevertheless give counsel to me  having well considered what is likely to be most safe both for my house and for you. Replying to this the Magians said:To us also  O king  it is of great consequence that thy rule should stand firm; for in the other case it is transferred to strangers  coming round to this boy who is a Persian  and we being Medes are made slaves and become of no account in the eyes of the Persians  seeing that we are of different race; but while thou art established as our king  who art one of our own nation  we both have our share of rule and receive great honours from thee. Thus then we must by all means have a care of thee and of thy rule. And now  if we saw in this anything to cause fear  we would declare all to thee beforehand: but as the dream has had its issue in a trifling manner  both we ourselves are of good cheer and we exhort thee to be so likewise: and as for this boy  send him away from before thine eyes to the Persians and to his parents.,mashup

Thus having spoken Astyages sent Cyrus away; and when he had returned and come to the house of Cambyses  his parents received him; and after that  when they learnt who he was  they welcomed him not a little  for they had supposed without doubt that their son had perished straightway after his birth; and they inquired in what manner he had survived. And he told them  saying that before this he had not known but had been utterly in error; on the way  however  he had learnt all his own fortunes: for he had supposed without doubt that he was the son of the herdsman of Astyages  but since his journey from the city began he had learnt the whole story from those who conducted him. And he said that he had been brought up by the wife of the herdsman  and continued to praise her throughout  so that Kyno was the chief person in his tale. And his parents took up this name from him  and in order that their son might be thought by the Persians to have been preserved in a more supernatural manner  they set on foot a report that Cyrus when he was exposed had been reared by a bitch: and from that source has come this report.,mashup

Then as Cyrus grew to be a man  being of all those of his age the most courageous and the best beloved  Harpagos sought to become his friend and sent him gifts  because he desired to take vengeance on Astyages. For he saw not how from himself  who was in a private station  punishment should come upon Astyages; but when he saw Cyrus growing up  he endeavoured to make him an ally  finding a likeness between the fortunes of Cyrus and his own. And even before that time he had effected something: for Astyages being harsh towards the Medes  Harpagos communicated severally with the chief men of the Medes  and persuaded them that they must make Cyrus their leader and cause Astyages to cease from being king. When he had effected this and when all was ready  then Harpagos wishing to make known his design to Cyrus  who lived among the Persians  could do it no other way  seeing that the roads were watched  but devised a scheme as follows:— he made ready a hare  and having cut open its belly but without pulling off any of the fur  he put into it  just as it was  a piece of paper  having written upon it that which he thought good; and then he sewed up again the belly of the hare  and giving nets as if he were a hunter to that one of his servants whom he trusted most  he sent him away to the land of the Persians  enjoining him by word of mouth to give the hare to Cyrus  and to tell him at the same time to open it with his own hands and let no one else be present when he did so.,mashup

This then was accomplished  and Cyrus having received from him the hare  cut it open; and having found within it the paper he took and read it over. And the writing said this:Son of Cambyses  over thee the gods keep guard  for otherwise thou wouldst never have come to so much good fortune. Do thou therefore take vengeance on Astyages who is thy murderer  for so far as his will is concerned thou art dead  but by the care of the gods and of me thou art still alive; and this I think thou hast long ago learnt from first to last  both how it happened about thyself  and also what things I have suffered from Astyages  because I did not slay thee but gave thee to the herdsman. If therefore thou wilt be guided by me  thou shalt be ruler of all that land over which now Astyages is ruler. Persuade the Persians to revolt  and march any army against the Medes: and whether I shall be appointed leader of the army against thee  or any other of the Medes who are in repute  thou hast what thou desirest; for these will be the first to attempt to destroy Astyages  revolting from him and coming over to thy party. Consider then that here at least all is ready  and therefore do this and do it with speed.,mashup

Cyrus having heard this began to consider in what manner he might most skilfully persuade the Persians to revolt  and on consideration he found that this was the most convenient way  and so in fact he did:— He wrote first on a paper that which he desired to write  and he made an assembly of the Persians. Then he unfolded the paper and reading from it said that Astyages appointed him commander of the Persians;and now  O Persians  he continued I give you command to come to me each one with a reaping-hook. Cyrus then proclaimed this command. (Now there are of the Persians many tribes  and some of them Cyrus gathered together and persuaded to revolt from the Medes  namely those  upon which all the other Persians depend  the Pasargadai  the Maraphians and the Maspians  and of these the Pasargadai are the most noble  of whom also the Achaimenidai are a clan  whence are sprung the Perseid kings. But other Persian tribes there are  as follows:— the Panthaliaians  the Derusiaians and the Germanians  these are all tillers of the soil; and the rest are nomad tribes  namely the Daoi  Mardians  Dropicans and Sagartians. ),mashup

Meanwhile Cyrus  having gathered together in one place all the flocks of goats and sheep and the herds of cattle belonging to his father  slaughtered them and prepared with them to entertain the host of the Persians  and moreover with wine and other provisions of the most agreeable kind. So when the Persians came on the next day  he made them recline in a meadow and feasted them. And when they had finished dinner  Cyrus asked them whether that which they had on the former day or that which they had now seemed to them preferable. They said that the difference between them was great  for the former day had for them nothing but evil  and the present day nothing but good. Taking up this saying Cyrus proceeded to lay bare his whole design  saying:Men of the Persians  thus it is with you. If ye will do as I say  ye have these and ten thousand other good things  with no servile labour; but if ye will not do as I say  ye have labours like that of yesterday innumerable. Now therefore do as I say and make yourselves free: for I seem to myself to have been born by providential fortune to take these matters in hand; and I think that ye are not worse men than the Medes  either in other matters or in those which have to do with war. Consider then that this is so  and make revolt from Astyages forthwith.,mashup

So the Persians having obtained a leader willingly attempted to set themselves free  since they had already for a long time been indignant to be ruled by the Medes: but when Astyages heard that Cyrus was acting thus  he sent a messenger and summoned him; and Cyrus bade the messenger report to Astyages that he would be with him sooner than he would himself desire. So Astyages hearing this armed all the Medes  and blinded by divine providence he appointed Harpagos to be the leader of the army  forgetting what he had done to him. Then when the Medes had marched out and began to fight with the Persians  some of them continued the battle  namely those who had not been made partakers in the design  while others went over to the Persians; but the greater number were wilfully slack and fled.,mashup

So when the Median army had been shamefully dispersed  so soon as Astyages heard of it he said  threatening Cyrus:But not even so shall Cyrus at least escape punishment. Thus having spoken he first impaled the Magian interpreters of dreams who had persuaded him to let Cyrus go  and then he armed those of the Medes  youths and old men  who had been left behind in the city. These he led out and having engaged battle with the Persians he was worsted  and Astyages himself was taken alive  and he lost also those of the Medes whom he had led forth.,mashup

Then when Astyages was a prisoner  Harpagos came and stood near him and rejoiced over him and insulted him; and besides other things which he said to grieve him  he asked him especially how it pleased him to be a slave instead of a king  making reference to that dinner at which Astyages had feasted him with the flesh of his own son. He looking at him asked him in return whether he claimed the work of Cyrus as his own deed: and Harpagos said that since he had written the letter  the deed was justly his. Then Astyages declared him to be at the same time the most unskilful and the most unjust of men; the most unskilful because  when it was in his power to become king (as it was  if that which had now been done was really brought about by him )  he had conferred the chief power on another  and the most unjust  because on account of that dinner he had reduced the Medes to slavery. For if he must needs confer the kingdom on some other and not keep it himself  it was more just to give this good thing to one of the Medes rather than to one of the Persians; whereas now the Medes  who were guiltless of this  had become slaves instead of masters  and the Persians who formerly were slaves of the Medes had now become their masters.,mashup

Astyages then  having been king for five-and-thirty years  was thus caused to cease from being king; and the Medes stooped under the yoke of the Persians because of his cruelty  after they had ruled Asia above the river Halys for one hundred and twenty-eight years  except during that period for which the Scythians had rule. Afterwards however it repented them that they had done this  and they revolved from Dareios  and having revolted they were subdued again  being conquered in a battle. At this time then  I say  in the reign of Astyages  the Persians with Cyrus rose up against the Medes and from that time forth were rulers of Asia: but as for Astyages  Cyrus did no harm to him besides  but kept him with himself until he died. Thus born and bred Cyrus became king; and after this he subdued Croesus  who was the first to begin the quarrel  as I have before said; and having subdued him he then became ruler of all Asia.,mashup

These are the customs  so far as I know  which the Persians practise:— Images and temples and altars they do not account it lawful to erect  nay they even charge with folly those who do these things; and this  as it seems to me  because they do not account the gods to be in the likeness of men  as do the Hellenes. But it is their wont to perform sacrifices to Zeus going up to the most lofty of the mountains  and the whole circle of the heavens they call Zeus: and they sacrifice to the Sun and the Moon and the Earth  to Fire and to Water and to the Winds: these are the only gods to whom they have sacrificed ever from the first; but they have learnt also to sacrifice to Aphrodite Urania  having learnt it both from the Assyrians and the Arabians; and the Assyrians call Aphrodite Mylitta  the Arabians Alitta  and the Persians Mitra.,mashup

Now this is the manner of sacrifice for the gods aforesaid which is established among the Persians:— they make no altars neither do they kindle fire; and when they mean to sacrifice they use no libation nor music of the pipe nor chaplets nor meal for sprinkling; but when a man wishes to sacrifice to any one of the gods  he leads the animal for sacrifice to an unpolluted place and calls upon the god  having his  tiara  wreathed round generally with a branch of myrtle. For himself alone separately the man who sacrifices may not request good things in his prayer  but he prays that it may be well with all the Persians and with the king; for he himself also is included of course in the whole body of Persians. And when he has cut up the victim into pieces and boiled the flesh  he spreads a layer of the freshest grass and especially clover  upon which he places forthwith all the pieces of flesh; and when he has placed them in order  a Magian man stands by them and chants over them a theogony (for of this nature they say that their incantation is )  seeing that without a Magian it is not lawful for them to make sacrifices. Then after waiting a short time the sacrificer carries away the flesh and uses it for whatever purpose he pleases.,mashup

And of all days their wont is to honour most that on which they were born  each one: on this they think it right to set out a feast more liberal than on other days; and in this feast the wealthier of them set upon the table an ox or a horse or a camel or an ass  roasted whole in an oven  and the poor among them set out small animals in the same way. They have few solid dishes  but many served up after as dessert  and these not in a single course; and for this reason the Persians say that the Hellenes leave off dinner hungry  because after dinner they have nothing worth mentioning served up as dessert  whereas if any good dessert were served up they would not stop eating so soon. To wine-drinking they are very much given  and it is not permitted for a man to vomit or to make water in presence of another. Thus do they provide against these things; and they are wont to deliberate when drinking hard about the most important of their affairs  and whatsoever conclusion has pleased them in their deliberation  this on the next day  when they are sober  the master of the house in which they happen to be when they deliberate lays before them for discussion: and if it pleases them when they are sober also  they adopt it  but if it does not please them  they let it go: and that on which they have had the first deliberation when they are sober  they consider again when they are drinking.,mashup

When they meet one another in the roads  by this you may discern whether those who meet are of equal rank — for instead of greeting by words they kiss one another on the mouth; but if one of them is a little inferior to the other  they kiss one another on the cheeks  and if one is of much less noble rank than the other  he falls down before him and does worship to him. And they honour of all most after themselves those nations which dwell nearest to them  and next those which dwell next nearest  and so they go on giving honour in proportion to distance; and they hold least in honour those who dwell furthest off from themselves  esteeming themselves to be by far the best of all the human race on every point  and thinking that others possess merit according to the proportion which is here stated  and that those who dwell furthest from themselves are the worst. And under the supremacy of the Medes the various nations used also to govern one another according to the same rule as the Persians observe in giving honour  the Medes governing the whole and in particular those who dwelt nearest to themselves  and these having rule over those who bordered upon them  and those again over the nations that were next to them: for the race went forward thus ever from government by themselves to government through others.,mashup

It is established as a sign of manly excellence next after excellence in fight  to be able to show many sons; and to those who have most the king sends gifts every year: for they consider number to be a source of strength. And they educate their children  beginning at five years old and going on till twenty  in three things only  in riding  in shooting  and in speaking the truth: but before the boy is five years old he does not come into the presence of his father  but lives with the women; and it is so done for this reason  that if the child should die while he is being bred up  he may not be the cause of any grief to his father.,mashup

Moreover they say that no one ever killed his own father or mother  but whatever deeds have been done which seemed to be of this nature  if examined must necessarily  they say  be found to be due either to changelings or to children of adulterous birth; for  say they  it is not reasonable to suppose that the true parent would be killed by his own son.,mashup

So much I am able to say for certain from my own knowledge about them: but what follows is reported about their dead as a secret mystery and not with clearness  namely that the body of a Persian man is not buried until it has been torn by a bird or a dog. (The Magians I know for a certainty have this practice  for they do it openly. ) However that may be  the Persians cover the body with wax and then bury it in the earth. Now the Magians are distinguished in many ways from other men  as also from the priests in Egypt: for these last esteem it a matter of purity to kill no living creature except the animals which they sacrifice; but the Magians kill with their own hands all creatures except dogs and men  and they even make this a great end to aim at  killing both ants and serpents and all other creeping and flying things. About this custom then be it as it was from the first established; and I return now to the former narrative.,mashup

The Ionians and Aiolians  as soon as the Lydians had been subdued by the Persians  sent messengers to Cyrus at Sardis  desiring to be his subjects on the same terms as they had been subjects of Croesus. And when he heard that which they proposed to him  he spoke to them a fable  saying that a certain player on the pipe saw fishes in the sea and played on his pipe  supposing that they would come out to land; but being deceived in his expectation  he took a casting-net and enclosed a great multitude of the fishes and drew them forth from the water: and when he saw them leaping about  he said to the fishes:Stop dancing I pray you now  seeing that ye would not come out and dance before when I piped. Cyrus spoke this fable to the Ionians and Aiolians for this reason  because the Ionians had refused to comply before  when Cyrus himself by a messenger requested them to revolt from Croesus  while now when the conquest had been made they were ready to submit to Cyrus. Thus he said to them in anger  and the Ionians  when they heard this answer brought back to their cities  put walls round about them severally  and gathered together to the Panionion  all except the men of Miletos  for with these alone Cyrus had sworn an agreement on the same terms as the Lydians had granted. The rest of the Ionians resolved by common consent to send messengers to Sparta  to ask the Spartans to help the Ionians.,mashup

These Ionians to whom belongs the Panionion had the fortune to build their cities in the most favourable position for climate and seasons of any men whom we know: for neither the regions above Ionia nor those below  neither those towards the East nor those towards the West  produce the same results as Ionia itself  the regions in the one direction being oppressed by cold and moisture  and those in the other by heat and drought. And these do not use all the same speech  but have four different variations of language. First of their cities on the side of the South lies Miletos  and next to it Myus and Priene. These are settlements made in Caria  and speak the same language with one another; and the following are in Lydia — Ephesos  Colophon  Lebedos  Teos  Clazomenai  Phocaia: these cities resemble not at all those mentioned before in the speech which they use  but they agree one with another. There remain besides three Ionian cities  of which two are established in the islands of Samos and Chios  and one is built upon the mainland  namely Erythrai: now the men of Chios and of Erythrai use the same form of language  but the Samians have one for themselves alone. Thus there result four separate forms of language.,mashup

Now these were parted off from the other Ionians for no other reason than this:— The whole Hellenic nation was at that time weak  but of all its races the Ionian was much the weakest and of least account: except Athens  indeed  it had no considerable city. Now the other Ionians  and among them the Athenians  avoided the name  not wishing to be called Ionians  nay even now I perceive that the greater number of them are ashamed of the name: but these twelve cities not only prided themselves on the name but established a temple of their own  to which they gave the name of Panionion  and they made resolution not to grant a share in it to any other Ionians (nor indeed did any ask to share it except those of Smyrna );,mashup

For example  in the games of the Triopian Apollo they used formerly to set bronze tripods as prizes for the victors  and the rule was that those who received them should not carry them out of the temple but dedicate them then and there to the god. There was a man then of Halicarnassos  whose name was Agasicles  who being a victor paid no regard to this rule  but carried away the tripod to his own house and hung it up there upon a nail. On this ground the other five cities  Lindos  Ialysos and Cameiros  Cos and Cnidos  excluded the sixth city Halicarnassos from sharing in the temple.,mashup

Upon these they laid this penalty: but as for the Ionians  I think that the reason why they made of themselves twelve cities and would not receive any more into their body  was because when they dwelt in Peloponnesus there were of them twelve divisions  just as now there are twelve divisions of the Achaians who drove the Ionians out: for first  (beginning from the side of Sikyon ) comes Pellene  then Aigeira and Aigai  in which last is the river Crathis with a perpetual flow (whence the river of the same name in Italy received its name )  and Bura and Helike  to which the Ionians fled for refuge when they were worsted by the Achaians in fight  and Aigion and Rhypes and Patreis and Phareis and Olenos  where is the great river Peiros  and Dyme and Tritaieis  of which the last alone has an inland position. These form now twelve divisions of the Achaians  and in former times they were divisions of the Ionians.,mashup

For this reason then the Ionians also made for themselves twelve cities; for at any rate to say that these are any more Ionians than the other Ionians  or have at all a nobler descent  is mere folly  considering that a large part of them are Abantians from Euboea  who have no share even in the name of Ionia  and Minyai of Orchomenos have been mingled with them  and Cadmeians and Dryopians and Phokians who seceded from their native State and Molossians and Pelasgians of Arcadia and Dorians of Epidauros and many other races have been mingled with them; and those of them who set forth to their settlements from the City Hall of Athens and who esteem themselves the most noble by descent of the Ionians  these  I say  brought no women with them to their settlement  but took Carian women  whose parents they slew: and on account of this slaughter these women laid down for themselves a rule  imposing oaths on one another  and handed it on to their daughters  that they should never eat with their husbands  nor should a wife call her own husband by name  for this reason  because the Ionians had slain their fathers and husbands and children and then having done this had them to wife. This happened at Miletos.,mashup

Moreover some of them set Lykian kings over them  descendants of Glaucos and Hippolochos  while others were ruled by Cauconians of Pylos  descendants of Codros the son of Melanthos  and others again by princes of the two races combined. Since however these hold on to the name more than the other Ionians  let them be called  if they will  the Ionians of truly pure descent; but in fact all are Ionians who have their descent from Athens and who keep the feast of Apaturia; and this all keep except the men of Ephesos and Colophon: for these alone of all the Ionians do not keep the Apaturia  and that on the ground of some murder committed.,mashup

Now the Panionion is a sacred place on the north side of Mycale  set apart by common agreement of the Ionians for Poseidon of Helike; and this Mycale is a promontory of the mainland running out Westwards towards Samos  where the Ionians gathering together from their cities used to hold a festival which they called the Panionia. (And not only the feasts of the Ionians but also those of all the Hellenes equally are subject to this rule  that their names all end in the same letter  just like the names of the Persians. ) These then are the Ionian cities:,mashup

Now the Aiolians lost Smyrna in the following manner:— certain men of Colophon  who had been worsted in party strife and had been driven from their native city  were received there for refuge: and after this the Colophonian exiles watched for a time when the men of Smyrna were celebrating a festival to Dionysos outside the walls  and then they closed the gates against them and got possession of the city. After this  when the whole body of Aiolians came to the rescue  they made an agreement that the Ionians should give up the movable goods  and that on this condition the Aiolians should abandon Smyrna. When the men of Smyrna had done this  the remaining eleven cities divided them amongst themselves and made them their own citizens.,mashup

He then put upon him a purple cloak  in order that as many as possible of the Spartans might hear of it and come together  and having been introduced before the assembly he spoke at length  asking the Spartans to help them. The Lacedemonians however would not listen to him  but resolved on the contrary not to help the Ionians. So they departed  and the Lacedemonians  having dismissed the messengers of the Ionians  sent men notwithstanding in a ship of fifty oars  to find out  as I imagine  about the affairs of Cyrus and about Ionia. These when they came to Phocaia sent to Sardis the man of most repute among them  whose name was Lacrines  to report to Cyrus the saying of the Lacedemonians  bidding him do hurt to no city of the Hellas  since they would not permit it.,mashup

These words Cyrus threw out scornfully with reference to the Hellenes in general  because they have got for themselves markets and practise buying and selling there; for the Persians themselves are not wont to use markets nor have they any market-place at all. After this he entrusted Sardis to Tabalos a Persian  and the gold both of Croesus and of the other Lydians he gave to Pactyas a Lydian to take charge of  and himself marched away to Agbatana  taking with him Croesus and making for the present no account of the Ionians. For Babylon stood in his way still  as also the Bactrian nation and the Sacans and the Egyptians; and against these he meant to make expeditions himself  while sending some other commander about the Ionians.,mashup

Hearing this on his way  Cyrus said to Croesus as follows:Croesus  what end shall I find of these things which are coming to pass? The Lydians will not cease as it seems  from giving trouble to me and from having it themselves. I doubt me if it were not best to sell them all as slaves; for as it is  I see that I have done in like manner as if one should slay the father and then spare his sons: just so I took prisoner and am carrying away thee  who wert much more than the father of the Lydians  while to the Lydians themselves I delivered up their city; and can I feel surprise after this that they have revolted from me ? Thus he said what was in his mind  but Croesus answered him as follows  fearing lest he should destroy Sardis:O king  that which thou hast said is not without reason; but do not thou altogether give vent to thy wrath  nor destroy an ancient city which is guiltless both of the former things and also of those which have come to pass now: for as to the former things it was I who did them and I bear the consequences heaped upon my head; and as for what is now being done  since the wrongdoer is Pactyas to whom thou didst entrust the charge of Sardis  let him pay the penalty. But the Lydians I pray thee pardon  and lay upon them commands as follows  in order that they may not revolt nor be a cause of danger to thee:— send to them and forbid them to possess weapons of war  but bid them on the other hand put on tunics under their outer garments and be shod with buskins  and proclaim to them that they train their sons to play the lyre and the harp and to be retail-dealers; and soon thou shalt see  O king  that they have become women instead of men  so that there will be no fear that they will revolt from thee.,mashup

Croesus  I say  suggested to him this  perceiving that this was better for the Lydians than to be reduced to slavery and sold; for he knew that if he did not offer a sufficient reason  he would not persuade Cyrus to change his mind  and he feared lest at some future time  if they should escape the present danger  the Lydians might revolt from the Persians and be destroyed. And Cyrus was greatly pleased with the suggestion made and slackened from his wrath  saying that he agreed with his advice. Then he called Mazares a Mede  and laid charge upon him to proclaim to the Lydians that which Croesus suggested  and moreover to sell into slavery all the rest who had joined with the Lydians in the expedition to Sardis  and finally by all means to bring Pactyas himself alive to Cyrus.,mashup

Having given this charge upon the road  he continued his march to the native land of the Persians; but Pactyas hearing that an army was approaching to fight against him was struck with fear and fled away forthwith to Kyme. Then Mazares the Mede marched upon Sardis with a certain portion of the army of Cyrus  and as he did not find Pactyas or his followers any longer at Sardis  he first compelled the Lydians to perform the commands of Cyrus  and by his commands the Lydians changed the whole manner of their life. After this Mazares proceeded to send messengers to Kyme bidding them give up Pactyas: and the men of Kyme resolved to refer to the god at Branchidai the question what counsel they should follow. For there was there an Oracle established of old time  which all the Ionians and Aiolians were wont to consult; and this place is in the territory of Miletos above the port of Panormos.,mashup

So the men of Kyme sent messengers to the Branchidai to inquire of the god  and they asked what course they should take about Pactyas so as to do that which was pleasing to the gods. When they thus inquired  the answer was given them that they should deliver up Pactyas to the Persians: and the men of Kyme  having heard this answer reported  were disposed to give him up. Then when the mass of the people were thus disposed  Aristodicos the son of Heracleides  a man of repute among the citizens  stopped the men of Kyme from doing so  having distrust of the answer and thinking that those sent to inquire were not speaking the truth; until at last other messengers were sent to the Oracle to ask a second time about Pactyas  and of them Aristodicos was one.,mashup

When these came to Branchidai  Aristodicos stood forth from the rest and consulted the Oracle  asking as follows: Lord  there came to us a suppliant for protection Pactyas the Lydian  flying from a violent death at the hands of the Persians  and they demand him from us  bidding the men of Kyme give him up. But we  though we fear the power of the Persians  yet have not ventured up to this time to deliver to them the suppliant  until thy counsel shall be clearly manifested to us  saying which of the two things we ought to do. He thus inquired  but the god again declared to them the same answer  bidding them deliver up Pactyas to the Persians. Upon this Aristodicos with deliberate purpose did as follows:— he went all round the temple destroying the nests of the sparrows and of all the other kinds of birds which had been hatched on the temple: and while he was doing this  it is said that a voice came from the inner shrine directed to Aristodicos and speaking thus:Thou most impious of men  why dost thou dare to do this? Dost thou carry away by force from my temple the suppliants for my protection ? And Aristodicos  it is said  not being at all at a loss replied to this:Lord  dost thou thus come to the assistance of thy suppliants  and yet biddest the men of Kyme deliver up theirs ? and the god answered him again thus:Yea  I bid you do so  that ye may perish the more quickly for your impiety; so that ye may not at any future time come to the Oracle to ask about delivering up of suppliants.,mashup

When the men of Kyme heard this saying reported  not wishing either to be destroyed by giving him up or to be besieged by keeping him with them  they sent him away to Mytilene. Those of Mytilene however  when Mazares sent messages to them  were preparing to deliver up Pactyas for a price  but what the price was I cannot say for certain  since the bargain was never completed; for the men of Kyme  when they learnt that this was being done by the Mytilenians  sent a vessel to Lesbos and conveyed away Pactyas to Chios. After this he was dragged forcibly from the temple of Athene Poliuchos by the Chians and delivered up: and the Chians delivered him up receiving Atarneus in return  (now this Atarneus is a region of Mysia opposition Lesbos ). So the Persians having received Pactyas kept him under guard  meaning to produce him before Cyrus. And a long time elapsed during which none of the Chians either used barley-meal grown in this region of Atarneus  for pouring out in sacrifice to any god  or baked cakes for offering of the corn which grew there  but all the produce of this land was excluded from every kind of sacred service.,mashup

Now these Phocaians were the first of the Hellenes who made long voyages  and these are they who discovered the Adriatic and Tyrsenia and Iberia and Tartessos: and they made voyages not in round ships  but in vessels of fifty oars. These came to Tartessos and became friends with the king of the Tartessians whose name was Arganthonios: he was ruler of the Tartessians for eighty years and lived in all one hundred and twenty. With this man  I say  the Phocaians became so exceedingly friendly  that first he bade them leave Ionia and dwell wherever they desired in his own land; and as he did not prevail upon the Phocaians to do this  afterwards  hearing from them of the Mede how his power was increasing  he gave them money to build a wall about their city: and he did this without sparing  for the circuit of the wall is many furlongs in extent  and it is built all of large stones closely fitted together.,mashup

The wall of the Phocaians was made in this manner: and Harpagos having marched his army against them began to besiege them  at the same time holding forth to them proposals and saying that it was enough to satisfy him if the Phocaians were willing to throw down one battlement of their wall and dedicate one single house. But the Phocaians  being very greatly grieved at the thought of subjection  said that they wished to deliberate about the matter for one day and after that they would give their answer; and they asked him to withdraw his army from the wall while they were deliberating. Harpagos said that he knew very well what they were meaning to do  nevertheless he was willing to allow them to deliberate. So in the time that followed  when Harpagos had withdrawn his army from the wall  the Phocaians drew down their fifty-oared galleys to the sea  put into them their children and women and all their movable goods  and besides them the images out of the temples and the other votive offerings except such as were made of bronze or stone or consisted of paintings  all the rest  I say  they put into the ships  and having embarked themselves they sailed towards Chios; and the Persians obtained possession of Phocaia  the city being deserted of the inhabitants.,mashup

But as for the Phocaians  since the men of Chios would not sell them at their request the islands called Oinussai  from the fear lest these islands might be made a seat of trade and their island might be shut out  therefore they set out for Kyrnos: for in Kyrnos twenty years before this they had established a city named Alalia  in accordance with an oracle  (now Arganthonios by that time was dead ). And when they were setting out for Kyrnos they first sailed to Phocaia and slaughtered the Persian garrison  to whose charge Harpagos had delivered the city; then after they had achieved this they made solemn imprecations on any one of them who should be left behind from their voyage  and moreover they sank a mass of iron in the sea and swore that not until that mass should appear again on the surface would they return to Phocaia. However as they were setting forth to Kyrnos  more than half of the citizens were seized with yearning and regret for their city and for their native land  and they proved false to their oath and sailed back to Phocaia. But those of them who kept the oath still  weighed anchor from the islands of Oinussai and sailed.,mashup

When these came to Kyrnos  for five years they dwelt together with those who had come thither before  and they founded temples there. Then  since they plundered the property of all their neighbours  the Tyrsenians and Carthaginians made expedition against them by agreement with one another  each with sixty ships. And the Phocaians also manned their vessels  sixty in number  and came to meet the enemy in that which is called the Sardinian sea: and when they encountered one another in the sea-fight the Phocaians won a kind of Cadmean victory  for forty of their ships were destroyed and the remaining twenty were disabled  having had their prows bent aside. So they sailed in to Alalia and took up their children and their women and their other possessions as much as their ships proved capable of carrying  and then they left Kyrnos behind them and sailed to Rhegion.,mashup

But as for the crews of the ships that were destroyed  the Carthaginians and Tyrsenians obtained much the greater number of them  and these they brought to land and killed by stoning. After this the men of Agylla found that everything which passed by the spot where the Phocaians were laid after being stoned  became either distorted  or crippled  or paralysed  both small cattle and beasts of burden and human creatures: so the men of Agylla sent to Delphi desiring to purge themselves of the offence; and the Pythian prophetess bade them do that which the men of Agylla still continue to perform  that is to say  they make great sacrifices in honour of the dead  and hold at the place a contest of athletics and horse-racing. These then of the Phocaians had the fate which I have said; but those of them who took refuge at Rhegion started from thence and took possession of that city in the land of Oinotria which now is called Hyele. This they founded having learnt from a man of Poseidonia that the Pythian prophetess by her answer meant them to found a temple to Kyrnos  who was a hero  and not to found a settlement in the island of Kyrnos.,mashup

These alone of all the Ionians left their native cities because they would not endure subjection: but the other Ionians except the Milesians did indeed contend in arms with Harpagos like those who left their homes  and proved themselves brave men  fighting each for his own native city; but when they were defeated and captured they remained all in their own place and performed that which was laid upon them: but the Milesians  as I have also said before  had made a sworn agreement with Cyrus himself and kept still. Thus for the second time Ionia had been reduced to subjection. And when Harpagos had conquered the Ionians on the mainland  then the Ionians who dwelt in the islands  being struck with fear by these things  gave themselves over to Cyrus.,mashup

When the Ionians had been thus evilly entreated but were continuing still to hold their gatherings as before at the Panionion  Bias a man of Priene set forth to the Ionians  as I am informed  a most profitable counsel  by following which they might have been the most prosperous of all the Hellenes. He urged that the Ionians should set forth in one common expedition and sail to Sardinia  and after that found a single city for all the Ionians: and thus they would escape subjection and would be prosperous  inhabiting the largest of all islands and being rulers over others; whereas  if they remained in Ionia  he did not perceive  he said  that freedom would any longer exist for them. This was the counsel given by Bias of Priene after the Ionians had been ruined; but a good counsel too was given before the ruin of Ionia by Thales a man of Miletos  who was by descent of Phenician race. He advised the Ionians to have one single seat of government  and that this should be at Teos (for Teos  he said  was in the centre of Ionia )  and that the other cities should be inhabited as before  but accounted just as if they were demes. These men set forth to them counsels of the kind which I have said:,mashup

Of these the Carians came to the mainland from the islands; for being of old time subjects of Minos and being called Leleges  they used to dwell in the islands  paying no tribute  so far back as I am able to arrive by hearsay  but whenever Minos required it  they used to supply his ships with seamen: and as Minos subdued much land and was fortunate in his fighting  the Carian nation was of all nations by much the most famous at that time together with him. And they produced three inventions of which the Hellenes adopted the use; that is to say  the Carians were those who first set the fashion of fastening crests on helmets  and of making the devices which are put onto shields  and these also were the first who made handles for their shields  whereas up to that time all who were wont to use shields carried them without handles and with leathern straps to guide them  having them hung about their necks and their left shoulders. Then after the lapse of a long time the Dorians and Ionians drove the Carians out of the islands  and so they came to the mainland. With respect to the Carians the Cretans relate that it happened thus; the Carians themselves however do not agree with this account  but suppose that they are dwellers on the mainland from the beginning  and that they went always by the same name which they have now: and they point as evidence of this to an ancient temple of Carian Zeus at Mylasa  in which the Mysians and Lydians share as being brother races of the Carians  for they say that Lydos and Mysos were brothers of Car; these share in it  but those who being of another race have come to speak the same language as the Carians  these have no share in it.,mashup

It seems to me however that the Caunians are dwellers there from the beginning  though they say themselves that they came from Crete: but they have been assimilated to the Carian race in language  or else the Carians to the Caunian race  I cannot with certainty determine which. They have customs however in which they differ very much from all other men as well as from the Carians; for example the fairest thing in their estimation is to meet together in numbers for drinking  according to equality of age or friendship  both men  women  and children; and again when they had founded temples for foreign deities  afterwards they changed their purpose and resolved to worship only their own native gods  and the whole body of Caunian young men put on their armour and made pursuit as far as the borders of the Calyndians  beating the air with their spears; and they said that they were casting the foreign gods out of the land. Such are the customs which these have.,mashup

Now while Sarpedon reigned over them  they were called by the name which they had when they came thither  and by which the Lykians are even now called by the neighbouring tribes  namely Termilai; but when from Athens Lycos the son of Pandion came to the land of the Termilai and to Sarpedon  he too having been driven out by his brother namely Aigeus  then by the name taken from Lycos they were called after a time Lykians. The customs which these have are partly Cretan and partly Carian; but one custom they have which is peculiar to them  and in which they agree with no other people  that is they call themselves by their mothers and not by their fathers; and if one asks his neighbour who he is  he will state his parentage on the mother's side and enumerate his mother's female ascendants: and if a woman who is a citizen marry a slave  the children are accounted to be of gentle birth; but if a man who is a citizen  though he were the first man among them  have a slave for wife or concubine  the children are without civil rights.,mashup

Now the Carians were reduced to subjection by Harpagos without any brilliant deed displayed either by the Carians themselves or by those of the Hellenes who dwell in this land. Of these last there are besides others the men of Cnidos  settlers from Lacedemon  whose land runs out into the sea  being in fact the region which is called Triopion  beginning from the peninsula of Bybassos: and since all the land of Cnidos except a small part is washed by the sea (for the part of it which looks towards the North is bounded by the Gulf of Keramos  and that which looks to the South by the sea off Syme and Rhodes )  therefore the men of Cnidos began to dig through this small part  which is about five furlongs across  while Harpagos was subduing Ionia  desiring to make their land an island: and within the isthmus all was theirs  for where the territory of Cnidos ends in the direction of the mainland  here is the isthmus which they were digging across. And while the Cnidians were working at it with a great number of men  it was perceived that the men who worked suffered injury much more than might have been expected and in a more supernatural manner  both in other parts of their bodies and especially in their eyes  when the rock was being broken up; so they sent men to ask the Oracle at Delphi what the cause of the difficulty was. And the Pythian prophetess  as the men of Cnidos themselves report  gave them this reply in trimeter verse:—Fence not the place with towers  nor dig the isthmus through; Zeus would have made your land an island  had he willed. When the Pythian prophetess had given this oracle  the men of Cnidos not only ceased from their digging but delivered themselves to Harpagos without resistance  when he came against them with his army.,mashup

After a time the Pedasians were conquered; and the Lykians  when Harpagos marched his army into the plain of Xanthos  came out against him and fought  few against many  and displayed proofs of valour; but being defeated and confined within their city  they gathered together into the citadel their wives and their children  their property and their servants  and after that they set fire to this citadel  so that it was all in flames  and having done so and sworn terrible oaths with one another  they went forth against the enemy and were slain in fight  that is to say all the men of Xanthos: and of the Xanthians who now claim to be Lykians the greater number have come in from abroad  except only eighty households; but these eighty households happened at that time to be away from their native place  and so they escaped destruction.

Cyrus  so soon as he had made subject to himself all other parts of the mainland  proceeded to attack the Assyrians. Now Assyria has doubtless many other great cities  but the most famous and the strongest  and the place where the seat of their monarchy had been established after Nineveh was destroyed  was Babylon; which was a city such as I shall say.— It lies in a great plain  and in size it is such that each face measures one hundred and twenty furlongs  the shape of the whole being square; thus the furlongs of the circuit of the city amount in all to four hundred and eighty. Such is the size of the city of Babylon  and it had a magnificence greater than all other cities of which we have knowledge. First there runs round it a trench deep and broad and full of water; then a wall fifty royal cubits in thickness and two hundred cubits in height: now the royal cubit is larger by three fingers than the common cubit.,mashup

As they dug the trench they made the earth which was carried out of the excavation into bricks  and having moulded enough bricks they baked them in kilns; and then afterwards  using hot asphalt for mortar and inserting reed mats at every thirty courses of brickwork  they built up first the edges of the trench and then the wall itself in the same manner: and at the top of the wall along the edges they built chambers of one story facing one another; and between the rows of chambers they left space to drive a four-horse chariot. In the circuit of the wall there are set a hundred gates made of bronze throughout  and the gate- posts and lintels likewise. Now there is another city distant from Babylon a space of eight days' journey  of which the name is Is; and there is a river there of no great size  and the name of the river is also Is  and it sends its stream into the river Euphrates.

Babylon then was walled in this manner; and there are two divisions of the city; for a river whose name is Euphrates parts it in the middle. This flows from the land of the Armenians and is large and deep and swift  and it flows out into the Erythraian sea. The wall then on each side has its bends carried down to the river  and from this point the return walls stretch along each bank of the stream in the form of a rampart of baked bricks: and the city itself is full of houses of three and four stories  and the roads by which it is cut up run in straight lines  including the cross roads which lead to the river; and opposite to each road there were set gates in the rampart which ran along the river  in many in number as the ways  and these also were of bronze and led like the ways to the river itself.,mashup

This wall then which I have mentioned is as it were a cuirass for the town  and another wall runs round within it  not much weaker for defence than the first but enclosing a smaller space. And in each division of the city was a building in the midst  in the one the king's palace of great extent and strongly fortified round  and in the other the temple of Zeus Belos with bronze gates  and this exists still up to my time and measures two furlongs each way  being of a square shape: and in the midst of the temple is built a solid tower measuring a furlong both in length and in breadth  and on this tower another tower has been erected  and another again upon this  and so on up to the number of eight towers. An ascent to these has been built running outside round about all the towers; and when one reaches about the middle of the ascent one finds a stopping-place and seats to rest upon  on which those who ascend sit down and rest: and on the top of the last tower there is a large cell  and in the cell a large couch is laid  well covered  and by it is placed a golden table: and there is no image there set up nor does any human being spend the night there except only one woman of the natives of the place  whomsoever the god shall choose from all the woman  as say the Chaldeans who are the priests of this god.,mashup

These same men say also  but I do not believe them  that the god himself comes often to the cell and rests upon the couch  as happens likewise in the Egyptian Thebes according to the report of the Egyptians  for there also a woman sleeps in the temple of the Theban Zeus (and both these women are said to abstain from commerce with men )  and as happens also with the prophetess of the god in Patara of Lykia  whenever there is one  for there is not always an Oracle there  but whenever there is one  then she is shut up during the nights in the temple within the cell.,mashup

There is moreover in the temple at Babylon another cell below  wherein is a great image of Zeus sitting  made of gold  and by it is placed a large table of gold  and his footstool and seat are of gold also; and  as the Chaldeans reported  the weight of the gold of which these things are made is eight hundred talents. Outside this cell is an altar of gold; and there is also another altar of great size  where full-grown animals are sacrificed  whereas on the golden altar it is not lawful to sacrifice any but young sucklings only: and also on the larger altar the Chaldeans offer one thousand talents of frankincense every year at the time when they celebrate the feast in honour of this god. There was moreover in these precincts still remaining at the time of Cyrus  a statue twelve cubits high  of gold and solid. This I did not myself see  but that which is related by the Chaldeans I relate. Against this statue Dareios the son of Hystaspes formed a design  but he did not venture to take it: it was taken however by Xerxes the son of Dareios  who also killed the priest when he forbade him to meddle with the statue. This temple  then  is thus adorned with magnificence  and there are also many private votive-offerings.,mashup

First  as regards the river Euphrates which flows through the midst of their city  whereas before this it flowed straight  she by digging channels above made it so winding that it actually comes three times in its course to one of the villages in Assyria; and the name of the village to which the Euphrates comes is Ardericca; and at this day those who travel from this Sea of ours to Babylon  in their voyage down the river Euphrates arrive three times at this same village and on three separate days. This she did thus; and she also piled up a mound along each bank of the river  which is worthy to cause wonder for its size and height: and at a great distance above Babylon  she dug a basin for a lake  which she caused to extend along at a very small distance from the river  excavating it everywhere of such depth as to come to water  and making the extent such that the circuit of it measured four hundred and twenty furlongs: and the earth which was dug out of this excavation she used up by piling it in mounds along the banks of the river: and when this had been dug by her she brought stones and set them all round it as a facing wall. Both these two things she did  that is she made the river to have a winding course  and she made the place which was dug out all into a swamp  in order that the river might run more slowly  having its force broken by going round many bends  and that the voyages might be winding to Babylon  and after the voyages there might succeed a long circuit of the pool. These works she carried out in that part where the entrance to the country was  and the shortest way to it from Media  so that the Medes might not have dealings with her kingdom and learn of her affairs.,mashup

These defences she cast round her city from the depth; and she made the following addition which was dependent upon them:— The city was in two divisions  and the river occupied the space between; and in the time of the former rulers  when any one wished to pass over from the one division to the other  he had to pass over in a boat  and that  as I imagine  was troublesome: she however made provision also for this; for when she was digging the basin for the lake she left this other monument of herself derived from the same work  that is  she caused stones to be cut of very great length  and when the stones were prepared for her and the place had been dug out  she turned aside the whole stream of the river into the place which she had been digging; and while this was being filled with water  the ancient bed of the river being dried up in the meantime  she both built up with baked bricks after the same fashion as the wall the edges of the river  where it flows through the city  and the places of descent leading from the small gateways to the river; and also about the middle of the city  as I judge  with the stones which she had caused to be dug out she proceeded to build a bridge  binding together the stones with iron and lead: and upon the top she laid squared timbers across  to remain there while it was daytime  over which the people of Babylon made the passage across; but at night they used to take away these timbers for this reason  namely that they might not go backwards and forwards by night and steal from one another: and when the place dug out had been made into a lake full of water by the river  and at the same time the bridge had been completed  then she conducted the Euphrates back into its ancient channel from the lake  and so the place dug out being made into a swamp was thought to have served a good purpose  and there had been a bridge set up for the men of the city.,mashup

This same queen also contrived a snare of the following kind:— Over that gate of the city through which the greatest number of people passed she set up for herself a tomb above the very gate itself. And on the tomb she engraved writing which said thus:If any of the kings of Babylon who come after me shall be in want of wealth  let him open my tomb and take as much as he desires; but let him not open it for any other cause  if he be not in want; for that will not be well. This tomb was undisturbed until the kingdom came to Dareios; but to Dareios it seemed that it was a monstrous thing not to make any use of this gate  and also  when there was money lying there  not to take it  considering that the money itself invited him to do so. Now the reason why he would not make any use of this gate was because the corpse would have been above his head as he drove through. He then  I say  opened the tomb and found not indeed money but the corpse  with writing which said thus:If thou hadst not been insatiable of wealth and basely covetous  thou wouldest not have opened the resting-places of the dead.,mashup

Now when Cyrus on his way towards Babylon arrived at the river Gyndes — of which river the springs are in the mountains of the Matienians  and it flows through the Dardanians and runs into another river  the Tigris  which flowing by the city of Opis runs out into the Erythraian Sea — when Cyrus  I say  was endeavouring to cross this river Gyndes  which is a navigable stream  then one of his sacred white horses in high spirit and wantonness went into the river and endeavoured to cross  but the stream swept it under water and carried it off forthwith. And Cyrus was greatly moved with anger against the river for having done thus insolently  and he threatened to make it so feeble that for the future even women could cross it easily without wetting the knee. So after this threat he ceased from his march against Babylon and divided his army into two parts; and having divided it he stretched lines and marked out straight channels  one hundred and eighty on each bank of the Gyndes  directed every way  and having disposed his army along them he commanded them to dig: so  as a great multitude was working  the work was completed indeed  but they spent the whole summer season at this spot working.,mashup

When Cyrus had taken vengeance on the river Gyndes by dividing it into three hundred and sixty channels  and when the next spring was just beginning  then at length he continued his advance upon Babylon: and the men of Babylon had marched forth out of their city and were awaiting him. So when in his advance he came near to the city  the Babylonians joined battle with him  and having been worsted in the fight they were shut up close within their city. But knowing well even before this that Cyrus was not apt to remain still  and seeing him lay hands on every nation equally  they had brought in provisions beforehand for very many years. So while these made no account of the siege  Cyrus was in straits what to do  for much time went by and his affairs made no progress onwards.,mashup

Therefore  whether it was some other man who suggested it to him when he was in a strait what to do  or whether he of himself perceived what he ought to do  he did as follows:— The main body of his army he posted at the place where the river runs into the city  and then again behind the city he set others  where the river issues forth from the city; and he proclaimed to his army that so soon as they should see that the stream had become passable  they should enter by this way into the city. Having thus set them in their places and in this manner exhorted them he marched away himself with that part of his army which was not fit for fighting: and when he came to the lake  Cyrus also did the same things which the queen of the Babylonians had done as regards the river and the lake; that is to say  he conducted the river by a channel into the lake  which was at that time a swamp  and so made the former course of the river passable by the sinking of the stream. When this had been done in such a manner  the Persians who had been posted for this very purpose entered by the bed of the river Euphrates into Babylon  the stream having sunk so far that it reached about to the middle of a man's thigh. Now if the Babylonians had had knowledge of it beforehand or had perceived that which was being done by Cyrus  they would have allowed the Persians to enter the city and then destroyed them miserably; for if they had closed all the gates that led to the river and mounted themselves upon the ramparts which were carried along the banks of the stream  they would have caught them as it were in a fish- wheal: but as it was  the Persians came upon them unexpectedly; and owing to the size of the city (so it is said by those who dwell there ) after those about the extremities of the city had suffered capture  those Babylonians who dwelt in the middle did not know that they had been captured; but as they chanced to be holding a festival  they went on dancing and rejoicing during this time until they learnt the truth only too well. Babylon then had thus been taken for the first time:,mashup

Now whereas twelve months go to make up the year  for four of these he has his support from the territory of Babylon  and for the remaining eight months from the whole of the rest of Asia; thus the Assyrian land is in regard to resources the third part of all Asia: and the government  or satrapy as it is called by the Persians  of this territory is of all the governments by far the best; seeing that when Tritantaichmes son of Artabazos had this province from the king  there came in to him every day an  artab  full of silver coin (now the  artab  is a Persian measure and holds more than the  medimnos  of Attica by three Attic  choinikes  ); and of horses he had in this province as his private property  apart from the horses for use in war  eight hundred stallions and sixteen thousand mares  for each of these stallions served twenty mares: of Indian hounds moreover such a vast number were kept that four large villages in the plain  being free from other contributions  had been appointed to provide food for the hounds.,mashup

Such was the wealth which belonged to the ruler of Babylon. Now the land of the Assyrians has but little rain; and this little gives nourishment to the root of the corn  but the crop is ripened and the ear comes on by the help of watering from the river  not as in Egypt by the coming up of the river itself over the fields  but the crop is watered by hand or with swing-buckets. For the whole Babylonian territory like the Egyptian is cut up into channels  and the largest of the channels is navigable for ships and runs in the direction of the sunrising in winter from the Euphrates to another river  namely the Tigris  along the bank of which lay the city of Nineveh. This territory is of all that we know the best by far for producing corn: as to trees  it does not even attempt to bear them  either fig or vine or olive  but for producing corn it is so good that it returns as much as two-hundred-fold for the average  and when it bears at its best it produces three-hundred-fold. The leaves of the wheat and barley there grow to be full four fingers broad; and from millet and sesame seed how large a tree grows  I know myself but shall not record  being well aware that even what has already been said relating to the crops produced has been enough to cause disbelief in those who have not visited the Babylonian land. They use no oil of olives  but only that which they make of sesame seed; and they have date-palms growing over all the plain  most of them fruit-bearing  of which they make both solid food and wine and honey; and to these they attend in the same manner as to fig-trees  and in particular they take the fruit of those palms which the Hellenes call male-palms  and tie them upon the date-bearing palms  so that their gall-fly may enter into the date and ripen it and that the fruit of the palm may not fall off: for the male-palm produces gall-flies in its fruit just as the wild-fig does.,mashup

But the greatest marvel of all the things in the land after the city itself  to my mind is this which I am about to tell: Their boats  those I mean which go down the river to Babylon  are round and all of leather: for they make ribs for them of willow which they cut in the land of the Armenians who dwell above the Assyrians  and round these they stretch hides which serve as a covering outside by way of hull  not making broad the stern nor gathering in the prow to a point  but making the boats round like a shield: and after that they stow the whole boat with straw and suffer it to be carried down the stream full of cargo; and for the most part these boats bring down casks of palm- wood filled with wine. The boat is kept straight by two steering- oars and two men standing upright  and the man inside pulls his oar while the man outside pushes. These vessels are made both of very large size and also smaller  the largest of them having a burden of as much as five thousand talents' weight; and in each one there is a live ass  and in those of larger size several. So when they have arrived at Babylon in their voyage and have disposed of their cargo  they sell by auction the ribs of the boat and all the straw  but they pack the hides upon their asses and drive them off to Armenia: for up the stream of the river it is not possible by any means to sail  owing to the swiftness of the current; and for this reason they make their boats not of timber but of hides. Then when they have come back to the land of the Armenians  driving their asses with them  they make other boats in the same manner.,mashup

Such is the equipment of their bodies: and the customs which are established among them are as follows  the wisest in our opinion being this  which I am informed that the Enetoi in Illyria also have. In every village once in each year it was done as follows:— When the maidens grew to the age for marriage  they gathered these all together and brought them in a body to one place  and round them stood a company of men: and the crier caused each one severally to stand up  and proceeded to sell them  first the most comely of all  and afterwards  when she had been sold and had fetched a large sum of money  he would put up another who was the most comely after her: and they were sold for marriage. Now all the wealthy men of the Babylonians who were ready to marry vied with one another in bidding for the most beautiful maidens; those however of the common sort who were ready to marry did not require a fine form  but they would accept money together with less comely maidens. For when the crier had made an end of selling the most comely of the maidens  then he would cause to stand up that one who was least shapely  or any one of them who might be crippled in any way  and he would make proclamation of her  asking who was willing for least gold to have her in marriage  until she was assigned to him who was willing to accept least: and the gold would be got from the sale of the comely maidens  and so those of beautiful form provided dowries for those which were unshapely or crippled; but to give in marriage one's own daughter to whomsoever each man would  was not allowed  nor to carry off the maiden after buying her without a surety; for it was necessary for the man to provide sureties that he would marry her  before he took her away; and if they did not agree well together  the law was laid down that he should pay back the money. It was allowed also for any one who wished it to come from another village and buy. This then was their most honourable custom; it does not however still exist at the present time  but they have found out of late another way  in order that the men may not ill-treat them or take them to another city: for since the time when being conquered they were oppressed and ruined  each one of the common people when he is in want of livelihood prostitutes his female children.,mashup

Next in wisdom to that  is this other custom which was established among them:— they bear out the sick into the market- place; for of physicians they make no use. So people come up to the sick man and give advice about his disease  if any one himself has ever suffered anything like that which the sick man has  or saw any other who had suffered it; and coming near they advise and recommend those means by which they themselves got rid of a like disease or seen some other get rid of it: and to pass by the sick man in silence is not permitted to them  nor until one has asked what disease he has.,mashup

Now the most shameful of the customs of the Babylonians is as follows: every woman of the country must sit down in the precincts of Aphrodite once in her life and have commerce with a man who is a stranger: and many women who do not deign to mingle with the rest  because they are made arrogant by wealth  drive to the temple with pairs of horses in covered carriages  and so take their place  and a large number of attendants follow after them; but the greater number do thus — in the sacred enclosure of Aphrodite sit great numbers of women with a wreath of cord about their heads; some come and others go; and there are passages in straight lines going between the women in every direction  through which the strangers pass by and make their choice. Here when a woman takes her seat she does not depart again to her house until one of the strangers has thrown a silver coin into her lap and has had commerce with her outside the temple  and after throwing it he must say these words only:I demand thee in the name of the goddess Mylitta: now Mylitta is the name given by the Assyrians to Aphrodite: and the silver coin may be of any value; whatever it is she will not refuse it  for that is not lawful for her  seeing that this coin is made sacred by the act: and she follows the man who has first thrown and does not reject any: and after that she departs to her house  having acquitted herself of her duty to the goddess  nor will you be able thenceforth to give any gift so great as to win her. So then as many as have attained to beauty and stature are speedily released  but those of them who are unshapely remain there much time  not being able to fulfil the law; for some of them remain even as much as three or four years: and in some parts of Cyprus too there is a custom similar to this.,mashup

These customs then are established among the Babylonians: and there are of them three tribes which eat nothing but fish only: and when they have caught them and dried them in the sun they do thus — they throw them into brine  and then pound them with pestles and strain them through muslin; and they have them for food either kneaded into a soft cake  or baked like bread  according to their liking.,mashup

Now the Araxes is said by some to be larger and by others to be smaller than the Ister: and they say that there are many islands in it about equal in size to Lesbos  and in them people dwelling who feed in the summer upon roots of all kinds which they dig up and certain fruits from trees  which have been discovered by them for food  they store up  it is said  in the season when they are ripe and feed upon them in the winter. Moreover it is said that other trees have been discovered by them which yield fruit of such a kind that when they have assembled together in companies in the same place and lighted a fire  they sit round in a circle and throw some of it into the fire  and they smell the fruit which is thrown on  as it burns  and are intoxicated by the scent as the Hellenes are with wine  and when more of the fruit is thrown on they become more intoxicated  until at last they rise up to dance and begin to sing. This is said to be their manner of living: and as to the river Araxes  it flows from the land of the Matienians  whence flows the Gyndes which Cyrus divided into the three hundred and sixty channels  and it discharges itself by forty branches  of which all except one end in swamps and shallow pools; and among them they say that men dwell who feed on fish eaten raw  and who are wont to use as clothing the skins of seals: but the one remaining branch of the Araxes flows with unimpeded course into the Caspian Sea.,mashup

Now the Caspian Sea is apart by itself  not having connection with the other Sea: for all that Sea which the Hellenes navigate  and the Sea beyond the Pillars  which is called Atlantis  and the Erythraian Sea are in fact all one  but the Caspian is separate and lies apart by itself. In length it is a voyage of fifteen days if one uses oars  and in breadth  where it is broadest  a voyage of eight days. On the side towards the West of this Sea the Caucasus runs along by it  which is of all mountain-ranges both the greatest in extent and the loftiest: and the Caucasus has many various races of men dwelling in it  living for the most part on the wild produce of the forests; and among them there are said to be trees which produce leaves of such a kind that by pounding them and mixing water with them they paint figures upon their garments  and the figures do not wash out  but grow old with the woollen stuff as if they had been woven into it at the first: and men say that the sexual intercourse of these people is open like that of cattle.,mashup

On the West then of this Sea which is called Caspian the Caucasus is the boundary  while towards the East and the rising sun a plain succeeds which is of limitless extent to the view. Of this great plain then the Massagetai occupy a large part  against whom Cyrus had become eager to march; for there were many strong reasons which incited him to it and urged him onwards — first the manner of his birth  that is to say the opinion held of him that he was more than a mere mortal man  and next the success which he had met with in his wars  for whithersoever Cyrus directed his march  it was impossible for that nation to escape.,mashup

Now the ruler of the Massagetai was a woman  who was queen after the death of her husband  and her name was Tomyris. To her Cyrus sent and wooed her  pretending that he desired to have her for his wife: but Tomyris understanding that he was wooing not herself but rather the kingdom of the Massagetai  rejected his approaches: and Cyrus after this  as he made no progress by craft  marched to the Araxes  and proceeded to make an expedition openly against the Massagetai  forming bridges of boats over the river for his army to cross  and building towers upon the vessels which gave them passage across the river.,mashup

While he was busied about this labour  Tomyris sent a herald and said thus:O king of the Medes  cease to press forward the work which thou art now pressing forward; for thou canst not tell whether these things will be in the end for thy advantage or no; cease to do so  I say  and be king over thine own people  and endure to see us ruling those whom we rule. Since however I know that thou wilt not be willing to receive this counsel  but dost choose anything rather than to be at rest  therefore if thou art greatly anxious to make trial of the Massagetai in fight  come now  leave that labour which thou hast in yoking together the banks of the river  and cross over into our land  when we have first withdrawn three days' journey from the river: or if thou desirest rather to receive us into your land  do thou this same thing thyself. Having heard this Cyrus called together the first men among the Persians  and having gathered these together he laid the matter before them for discussion  asking their advice as to which of the two things he should do: and their opinions all agreed in one  bidding him receive Tomyris and her army into his country.,mashup

But Croesus the Lydian  being present and finding fault with this opinion  declared an opinion opposite to that which had been set forth  saying as follows:O king  I told thee in former time also  that since Zeus had given me over to thee  I would avert according to my power whatever occasion of falling I might see coming near thy house: and now my sufferings  which have been bitter  have proved to be lessons of wisdom to me. If thou dost suppose that thou art immortal and that thou dost command an army which is also immortal  it will be of no use for me to declare to thee my judgment; but if thou hast perceived that thou art a mortal man thyself and dost command others who are so likewise  then learn this first  that for the affairs of men there is a revolving wheel  and that this in its revolution suffers not the same persons always to have good fortune. I therefore now have an opinion about the matter laid before us  which is opposite to that of these men: for if we shall consent to receive the enemy into our land  there is for thee this danger in so doing:— if thou shalt be worsted thou wilt lose in addition all thy realm  for it is evident that if the Massagetai are victors they will not turn back and fly  but will march upon the provinces of thy realm; and on the other hand if thou shalt be the victor  thou wilt not be victor so fully as if thou shouldest overcome the Massagetai after crossing over into their land and shouldest pursue them when they fled. For against that which I said before I will set the same again here  and say that thou  when thou hast conquered  wilt march straight against the realm of Tomyris. Moreover besides that which has been said  it is a disgrace and not to be endured that Cyrus the son of Cambyses should yield to a woman and so withdraw from her land. Now therefore it seems good to me that we should cross over and go forward from the crossing as far as they go in their retreat  and endeavour to get the better of them by doing as follows:— The Massagetai  as I am informed  are without experience of Persian good things  and have never enjoyed any great luxuries. Cut up therefore cattle without stint and dress the meat and set out for these men a banquet in our camp: moreover also provide without stint bowls of unmixed wine and provisions of every kind; and having so done  leave behind the most worthless part of thy army and let the rest begin to retreat from the camp towards the river: for if I am not mistaken in my judgment  they when they see a quantity of good things will fall to the feast  and after that it remains for us to display great deeds.,mashup

She then proceeded to retire  as she had at first engaged to do  but Cyrus delivered Croesus into the hands of his son Cambyses  to whom he meant to give the kingdom  and gave him charge earnestly to honour him and to treat him well  if the crossing over to go against the Massagetai should not be prosperous.

And when he had passed over the Araxes  night having come on he saw a vision in his sleep in the land of the Massagetai  as follows:— in his sleep it seemed to Cyrus that he saw the eldest of the sons of Hystaspes having upon his shoulders wings  and that with the one of these he overshadowed Asia and with the other Europe. Now of Hystaspes the son of Arsames  who was a man of the Achaimenid clan  the eldest son was Dareios  who was then  I suppose  a youth of about twenty years of age  and he had been left behind in the land of the Persians  for he was not yet of full age to go out to the wars. So then when Cyrus awoke he considered with himself concerning the vision: and as the vision seemed to him to be of great import  he called Hystaspes  and having taken him apart by himself he said:Hystaspes  thy son has been found plotting against me and against my throne: and how I know this for certain I will declare to thee:— The gods have a care of me and show me beforehand all the evils that threaten me. So in the night that is past while sleeping I saw the eldest of thy sons having upon his shoulders wings  and with the one of these he overshadowed Asia and with the other Europe. To judge by this vision then  it cannot be but that he is plotting against me. Do thou therefore go by the quickest way back to Persia and take care that  when I return thither after having subdued these regions  thou set thy son before me to be examined.,mashup

Cyrus said thus supposing that Dareios was plotting against him; but in fact the divine powers were showing him beforehand that he was destined to find his end there and that his kingdom was coming about to Dareios. To this then Hystaspes replied as follows:O king  heaven forbid that there should be any man of Persian race who would plot against thee  and if there be any  I pray that he perish as quickly as may be; seeing that thou didst make the Persians to be free instead of slaves  and to rule all nations instead of being ruled by others.

Hystaspes then  having made answer with these words and having crossed over the Araxes  was going his way to the Persian land to keep watch over his son Dareios for Cyrus; and Cyrus meanwhile went forward and made a march of one day from the Araxes according to the suggestion of Croesus. After this when Cyrus and the best part of the army of the Persians had marched back to the Araxes  and those who were unfit for fighting had been left behind  then a third part of the army of the Massagetai came to the attack and proceeded to slay  not without resistance  those who were left behind of the army of Cyrus; and seeing the feast that was set forth  when they had overcome their enemies they lay down and feasted  and being satiated with food and wine they went to sleep. Then the Persians came upon them and slew many of them  and took alive many more even than they slew  and among these the son of the queen Tomyris  who was leading the army of the Massagetai; and his name was Spargapises.,mashup

This battle of all the battles fought by Barbarians I judge to have been the fiercest  and I am informed that it happened thus:— first  it is said  they stood apart and shot at one another  and afterwards when their arrows were all shot away  they fell upon one another and engaged in close combat with their spears and daggers; and so they continued to be in conflict with one another for a long time  and neither side would flee; but at last the Massagetai got the better in the fight: and the greater part of the Persian army was destroyed there on the spot  and Cyrus himself brought his life to an end there  after he had reigned in all thirty years wanting one. Then Tomyris filled a skin with human blood and had search made among the Persian dead for the corpse of Cyrus: and when she found it  she let his head down into the skin and doing outrage to the corpse she said at the same time this:Though I yet live and have overcome thee in fight  nevertheless thou didst undo me by taking my son with craft: but I according to my threat will give thee thy fill of blood. Now as regards the end of the life of Cyrus there are many tales told  but this which I have related is to my mind the most worthy of belief.,mashup

These are the customs which they have:— Each marries a wife  but they have their wives in common; for that which the Hellenes say that the Scythians do  is not in fact done by the Scythians but by the Massagetai  that is to say  whatever woman a man of the Massagetai may desire he hangs up his quiver in front of the waggon and has commerce with her freely. They have no precise limit of age laid down for their life  but when a man becomes very old  his nearest of kin come together and slaughter him solemnly and cattle also with him; and then after that they boil the flesh and banquet upon it. This is considered by them the happiest lot; but him who has ended his life by disease they do not eat  but cover him up in the earth  counting it a misfortune that he did not attain to being slaughtered. They sow no crops but live on cattle and on fish  which last they get in abundance from the river Araxes; moreover they are drinkers of milk. Of gods they reverence the Sun alone  and to him they sacrifice horses: and the rule of the sacrifice is this:— to the swiftest of the gods they assign the swiftest of all mortal things.,mashup

Now the Egyptians  before the time when Psammetichos became king over them  were wont to suppose that they had come into being first of all men; but since the time when Psammetichos having become king desired to know what men had come into being first  they suppose that the Phrygians came into being before themselves  but they themselves before all other men. Now Psammetichos  when he was not able by inquiry to find out any means of knowing who had come into being first of all men  contrived a device of the following kind:— Taking two new- born children belonging to persons of the common sort he gave them to a shepherd to bring up at the place where his flocks were  with a manner of bringing up such as I shall say  charging him namely that no man should utter any word in their presence  and that they should be placed by themselves in a room where none might come  and at the proper time he should bring to them she-goats  and when he had satisfied them with milk he should do for them whatever else was needed. These things Psammetichos did and gave him this charge wishing to hear what word the children would let break forth first  after they had ceased from wailings without sense. And accordingly so it came to pass; for after a space of two years had gone by  during which the shepherd went on acting so  at length  when he opened the door and entered  both the children fell before him in entreaty and uttered the word  bekos  stretching forth their hands. At first when he heard this the shepherd kept silence; but since this word was often repeated  as he visited them constantly and attended to them  at last he declared the matter to his master  and at his command he brought the children before his face. Then Psammetichos having himself also heard it  began to inquire about what nation of men named anything  bekos  and inquiring he found that the Phrygians had this name for bread. In this manner and guided by an indication such as this  the Egyptians were brought to allow that the Phrygians were a more ancient people than themselves.,mashup

That so it came to pass I heard from the priests of that Hephaistos who dwells at Memphis; but the Hellenes relate  besides many other idle tales  that Psammetichos cut out the tongues of certain women  and then caused the children to live with these women. With regard then to the rearing of the children they related so much as I have said: and I heard also other things at Memphis when I had speech with the priests of Hephaistos. Moreover I visited both Thebes and Heliopolis for this very cause  namely because I wished to know whether the priests at these places would agree in their accounts with those at Memphis; for the men of Heliopolis are said to be the most learned in records of the Egyptians. Those of their narrations which I heard with regard to the gods I am not earnest to relate in full  but I shall name them only  because I consider that all men are equally ignorant of these matters: and whatever things of them I may record  I shall record only because I am compelled by the course of the story.,mashup

But as to those matters which concern men  the priests agreed with one another in saying that the Egyptians were the first of all men on earth to find out the course of the year  having divided the seasons into twelve parts to make up the whole; and this they said they found out from the stars: and they reckon to this extent more wisely than the Hellenes  as it seems to me  inasmuch as the Hellenes throw in an intercalated month every other year  to make the seasons right  whereas the Egyptians  reckoning the twelve months at thirty days each  bring in also every year five days beyond the number  and thus the circle of their seasons is completed and comes round to the same point whence it set out. They said moreover that the Egyptians were the first who brought into use appellations for the twelve gods and the Hellenes took up the use from them; and that they were the first who assigned altars and images and temples to the gods  and who engraved figures on stones; and with regard to the greater number of these things they showed me by actual facts that they had happened so. They said also that the first man who became king of Egypt was Min; and that in his time all Egypt except the district of Thebes was a swamp  and none of the regions were then above water which now lie below the lake of Moiris  to which lake it is a voyage of seven days up the river from the sea:,mashup

This then so far shows that there is a silting forward of the land.,mashup

Then secondly  as to Egypt itself  the extent of it along the sea is sixty  schoines  according to our definition of Egypt as extending from the Gulf of Plinthine to the Serbonian lake  along which stretches Mount Casion; from this lake then the sixty  schoines  are reckoned: for those of men who are poor in land have their country measured by fathoms  those who are less poor by furlongs  those who have much land by parasangs  and those who have land in very great abundance by  schoines: now the parasang is equal to thirty furlongs  and each  schoine  which is an Egyptian measure  is equal to sixty furlongs. So there would be an extent of three thousand six hundred furlongs for the coast-land of Egypt.,mashup

From thence and as far as Heliopolis inland Egypt is broad  and the land is all flat and without springs of water and formed of mud: and the road as one goes inland from the sea to Heliopolis is about the same in length as that which leads from the altar of the twelve gods at Athens to Pisa and the temple of Olympian Zeus: reckoning up you would find the difference very small by which these roads fail of being equal in length  not more indeed than fifteen furlongs; for the road from Athens to Pisa wants fifteen furlongs of being fifteen hundred  while the road to Heliopolis from the sea reaches that number completely.,mashup

From Heliopolis however  as you go up  Egypt is narrow; for on the one side a mountain-range belonging to Arabia stretches along by the side of it  going in a direction from North towards the midday and the South Wind  tending upwards without a break to that which is called the Erythraian Sea  in which range are the stone-quarries which were used in cutting stone for the pyramids at Memphis. On this side then the mountain ends where I have said  and then takes a turn back; and where it is widest  as I was informed  it is a journey of two months across from East to West; and the borders of it which turn towards the East are said to produce frankincense. Such then is the nature of this mountain-range; and on the side of Egypt towards Libya another range extends  rocky and enveloped in sand: in this are the pyramids  and it runs in the same direction as those parts of the Arabian mountains which go towards the midday. So then  I say  from Heliopolis the land has no longer a great extent so far as it belongs to Egypt  and for about four days' sail up the river Egypt properly so called is narrow: and the space between the mountain-ranges which have been mentioned is plain-land  but where it is narrowest it did not seem to me to exceed two hundred furlongs from the Arabian mountains to those which are called the Libyan. After this again Egypt is broad.,mashup

Of this land then  concerning which I have spoken  it seemed to myself also  according as the priests said  that the greater part had been won as an addition by the Egyptians; for it was evident to me that the space between the aforesaid mountain-ranges  which lie above the city of Memphis  once was a gulf of the sea  like the regions about Ilion and Teuthrania and Ephesos and the plain of the Maiander  if it be permitted to compare small things with great; and small these are in comparison  for of the rivers which heaped up the soil in those regions none is worthy to be compared in volume with a single one of the mouths of the Nile  which has five mouths. Moreover there are other rivers also  not in size at all equal to the Nile  which have performed great feats; of which I can mention the names of several  and especially the Achelo�s  which flowing through Acarnania and so issuing out into the sea has already made half of the Echinades from islands into mainland.,mashup

With respect to the length of the voyage along it  one who set out from the innermost point to sail out through it into the open sea  would spend forty days upon the voyage  using oars; and with respect to breadth  where the gulf is broadest it is half a day's sail across: and there is in it an ebb and flow of tide every day. Just such another gulf I suppose that Egypt was  and that the one ran in towards Ethiopia from the Northern Sea  and the other  the Arabian  of which I am about to speak  tended from the South towards Syria  the gulfs boring in so as almost to meet at their extreme points  and passing by one another with but a small space left between. If then the stream of the Nile should turn aside into this Arabian gulf  what would hinder that gulf from being filled up with silt as the river continued to flow  at all events within a period of twenty thousand years? indeed for my part I am of opinion that it would be filled up even within ten thousand years. How  then  in all the time that has elapsed before I came into being should not a gulf be filled up even of much greater size than this by a river so great and so active?,mashup

As regards Egypt then  I both believe those who say that things are so  and for myself also I am strongly of opinion that they are so; because I have observed that Egypt runs out into the sea further than the adjoining land  and that shells are found upon the mountains of it  and an efflorescence of salt forms upon the surface  so that even the pyramids are being eaten away by it  and moreover that of all the mountains of Egypt  the range which lies above Memphis is the only one which has sand: besides which I notice that Egypt resembles neither the land of Arabia  which borders upon it  nor Libya  nor yet Syria (for they are Syrians who dwell in the parts of Arabia lying along the sea )  but that it has soil which is black and easily breaks up  seeing that it is in truth mud and silt brought down from Ethiopia by the river: but the soil of Libya  we know  is reddish in colour and rather sandy  while that of Arabia and Syria is somewhat clayey and rocky.,mashup

The priests also gave me a strong proof concerning this land as follows  namely that in the reign of king Moiris  whenever the river reached a height of at least eight cubits it watered Egypt below Memphis; and not yet nine hundred years had gone by since the death of Moiris  when I heard these things from the priests: now however  unless the river rises to sixteen cubits  or fifteen at the least  it does not go over the land. I think too that those Egyptians who dwell below the lake of Moiris and especially in that region which is called the Delta  if that land continues to grow in height according to this proportion and to increase similarly in extent  will suffer for all remaining time  from the Nile not overflowing their land  that same thing which they themselves said that the Hellenes would at some time suffer: for hearing that the whole land of the Hellenes has rain and is not watered by rivers as theirs is  they said that the Hellenes would at some time be disappointed of a great hope and would suffer the ills of famine. This saying means that if the god shall not send them rain  but shall allow drought to prevail for a long time  the Hellenes will be destroyed by hunger; for they have in fact no other supply of water to save them except from Zeus alone.,mashup

This has been rightly said by the Egyptians with reference to the Hellenes: but now let me tell how matters are with the Egyptians themselves in their turn. If  in accordance with what I before said  their land below Memphis (for this is that which is increasing ) shall continue to increase in height according to the same proportion as in past time  assuredly those Egyptians who dwell here will suffer famine  if their land shall not have rain nor the river be able to go over their fields. It is certain however that now they gather in fruit from the earth with less labour than any other men and also with less than the other Egyptians; for they have no labour in breaking up furrows with a plough nor in hoeing nor in any other of those labours which other men have about a crop; but when the river has come up of itself and watered their fields and after watering has left them again  then each man sows his own field and turns into it swine  and when he has trodden the seed into the ground by means of the swine  after that he waits for the harvest; and when he has threshed the corn by means of the swine  then he gathers it in.,mashup

If we desire to follow the opinions of the Ionians as regards Egypt  who say that the Delta alone is Egypt  reckoning its sea-coast to be from the watch-tower called of Perseus to the fish-curing houses of Pelusion  a distance of forty  schoines  and counting it to extend inland as far as the city of Kercasoros  where the Nile divides and runs to Pelusion and Canobos  while as for the rest of Egypt  they assign it partly to Libya and partly to Arabia — if  I say  we should follow this account  we should thereby declare that in former times the Egyptians had no land to live in; for  as we have seen  their Delta at any rate is alluvial  and has appeared (so to speak ) lately  as the Egyptians themselves say and as my opinion is. If then at the first there was no land for them to live in  why did they waste their labour to prove that they had come into being before all other men? They needed not to have made trial of the children to see what language they would first utter. However I am not of opinion that the Egyptians came into being at the same time as that which is called by the Ionians the Delta  but that they existed always ever since the human race came into being  and that as their land advanced forwards  many of them were left in their first abodes and many came down gradually to the lower parts. At least it is certain that in old times Thebes had the name of Egypt  and of this the circumference measures six thousand one hundred and twenty furlongs.,mashup

We dismiss then the opinion of the Ionians  and express a judgment of our own in this matter also  that Egypt is all that land which is inhabited by Egyptians  just as Kilikia is that which is inhabited by Kilikians and Assyria that which is inhabited by Assyrians  and we know of no boundary properly speaking between Asia and Libya except the borders of Egypt. If however we shall adopt the opinion which is commonly held by the Hellenes  we shall suppose that the whole of Egypt  beginning from the Cataract and the city of Elephantine  is divided into two parts and that it thus partakes of both the names  since one side will thus belong to Libya and the other to Asia; for the Nile from the Cataract onwards flows to the sea cutting Egypt through the midst; and as far as the city of Kercasoros the Nile flows in one single stream  but from this city onwards it is parted into three ways; and one  which is called the Pelusian mouth  turns towards the East; the second of the ways goes towards the West  and this is called the Canobic mouth; but that one of the ways which is straight runs thus — when the river in its course downwards comes to the point of the Delta  then it cuts the Delta through the midst and so issues out to the sea. In this we have a portion of the water of the river which is not the smallest nor the least famous  and it is called the Sebennytic mouth. There are also two other mouths which part off from the Sebennytic and go to the sea  and these are called  one the Saitic  the other the Mendesian mouth. The Bolbitinitic and Bucolic mouths  on the other hand  are not natural but made by digging.,mashup

Moreover also the answer given by the Oracle of Ammon bears witness in support of my opinion that Egypt is of the extent which I declare it to be in my account; and of this answer I heard after I had formed my own opinion about Egypt. For those of the city of Marea and of Apis  dwelling in the parts of Egypt which border on Libya  being of opinion themselves that they were Libyans and not Egyptians  and also being burdened by the rules of religious service  because they desired not to be debarred from the use of cows' flesh  sent to Ammon saying that they had nought in common with the Egyptians  for they dwelt outside the Delta and agreed with them in nothing; and they said they desired that it might be lawful for them to eat everything without distinction. The god however did not permit them to do so  but said that that land which was Egypt which the Nile came over and watered  and that those were Egyptians who dwelling below the city of Elephantine drank of that river. Thus it was answered to them by the Oracle about this:,mashup

As regards the nature of the river  neither from the priests nor yet from any other man was I able to obtain any knowledge: and I was desirous especially to learn from them about these matters  namely why the Nile comes down increasing in volume from the summer solstice onwards for a hundred days  and then  when it has reached the number of these days  turns and goes back  failing in its stream  so that through the whole winter season it continues to be low  and until the summer solstice returns. Of none of these things was I able to receive any account from the Egyptians  when I inquired of them what power the Nile has whereby it is of a nature opposite to that of other rivers. And I made inquiry  desiring to know both this which I say and also why  unlike all other rivers  it does not give rise to any breezes blowing from it.,mashup

However some of the Hellenes who desired to gain distinction for cleverness have given an account of this water in three different ways: two of these I do not think it worth while even to speak of except only to indicate their nature; of which the one says that the Etesian Winds are the cause that makes the river rise  by preventing the Nile from flowing out into the sea. But often the Etesian Winds fail and yet the Nile does the same work as it is wont to do; and moreover  if these were the cause  all the other rivers also which flow in a direction opposed to the Etesian Winds ought to have been affected in the same way as the Nile  and even more  in as much as they are smaller and present to them a feebler flow of stream: but there are many of these rivers in Syria and many also in Libya  and they are affected in no such manner as the Nile.,mashup

The third of the ways is much the most specious  but nevertheless it is the most mistaken of all: for indeed this way has no more truth in it than the rest  alleging as it does that the Nile flows from melting snow; whereas it flows out of Libya through the midst of the Ethiopians  and so comes out into Egypt. How then should it flow from snow  when it flows from the hottest parts to those which are cooler? And indeed most of the facts are such as to convince a man (one at least who is capable of reasoning about such matters )  that it is not at all likely that it flows from snow. The first and greatest evidence is afforded by the winds  which blow hot from these regions; the second is that the land is rainless always and without frost  whereas after snow has fallen rain must necessarily come within five days  so that if it snowed in those parts rain would fall there; the third evidence is afforded by the people dwelling there  who are of a black colour by reason of the burning heat. Moreover kites and swallows remain there through the year and do not leave the land; and cranes flying from the cold weather which comes on in the region of Scythia come regularly to these parts for wintering: if then it snowed ever so little in that land through which the Nile flows and in which it has its rise  none of these things would take place  as necessity compels us to admit.,mashup

If however after I have found fault with the opinions proposed  I am bound to declare an opinion of my own about the matters which are in doubt  I will tell what to my mind is the reason why the Nile increases in the summer. In the winter season the Sun  being driven away from his former path through the heaven by the stormy winds  comes to the upper parts of Libya. If one would set forth the matter in the shortest way  all has now been said; for whatever region this god approaches most and stands directly above  this it may reasonably be supposed is most in want of water  and its native streams of rivers are dried up most.,mashup

However  to set it forth at greater length  thus it is:— the Sun passing in his course by the upper parts of Libya  does thus  that is to say  since at all times the air in those parts is clear and the country is warm  because there are no cold winds  in passing through it the Sun does just as he was wont to do in the summer  when going through the midst of the heaven  that is he draws to himself the water  and having drawn it he drives it away to the upper parts of the country  and the winds take it up and scattering it abroad melt it into rain; so it is natural that the winds which blow from this region  namely the South and South-west Winds  should be much the most rainy of all the winds. I think however that the Sun does not send away from himself all the water of the Nile of each year  but that he also lets some remain behind with himself. Then when the winter becomes milder  the Sun returns back again to the midst of the heaven  and from that time onwards he draws equally from all rivers; but in the meanwhile they flow in large volume  since water of rain mingles with them in great quantity  because their country receives rain then and is filled with torrent streams. In summer however they are weak  since not only the showers of rain fail then  but also they are drawn by the Sun. The Nile however  alone of all rivers  not having rain and being drawn by the Sun  naturally flows during this time of winter in much less than its proper volume  that is much less than in summer; for then it is drawn equally with all the other waters  but in winter it bears the burden alone. Thus I suppose the Sun to be the cause of these things.,mashup

He is also the cause in my opinion that the air in these parts is dry  since he makes it so by scorching up his path through the heaven: thus summer prevails always in the upper parts of Libya. If however the station of the seasons had been changed  and where now in the heaven are placed the North Wind and winter  there was the station of the South Wind and of the midday  and where now is placed the South Wind  there was the North  if this had been so  the Sun being driven from the midst of the heaven by the winter and the North Wind would go to the upper parts of Europe  just as now he comes to the upper parts of Libya  and passing in his course throughout the whole of Europe I suppose that he would do to the Ister that which he now works upon the Nile.,mashup

Let these matters then be as they are and as they were at the first: but as to the sources of the Nile  not one either of the Egyptians or of the Libyans or of the Hellenes  who came to speech with me  professed to know anything  except the scribe of the sacred treasury of Athene at the city of Sais in Egypt. To me however this man seemed not to be speaking seriously when he said that he had certain knowledge of it; and he said as follows  namely that there were two mountains of which the tops ran up to a sharp point  situated between the city of Syene  which is in the district of Thebes  and Elephantine  and the names of the mountains were  of the one Crophi and of the other Mophi. From the middle between these two mountains flowed (he said ) the sources of the Nile  which were fathomless in depth  and half of the water flowed to Egypt and towards the North Wind  the other half to Ethiopia and the South Wind. As for the fathomless depth of the source  he said that Psammetichos king of Egypt came to a trial of this matter; for he had a rope twisted of many thousands of fathoms and let it down in this place  and it found no bottom. By this the scribe (if this which he told me was really as he said ) gave me to understand that there were certain strong eddies there and a backward flow  and that since the water dashed against the mountains  therefore the sounding-line could not come to any bottom when it was let down.,mashup

From no other person was I able to learn anything about this matter; but for the rest I learnt so much as here follows by the most diligent inquiry; for I went myself as an eye-witness as far as the city of Elephantine and from that point onwards I gathered knowledge by report. From the city of Elephantine as one goes up the river there is country which slopes steeply; so that here one must attach ropes to the vessel on both sides  as one fastens an ox  and so make one's way onward; and if the rope break  the vessel is gone at once  carried away by the violence of the stream. Through this country it is a voyage of about four days in length  and in this part the Nile is winding like the river Maiander  and the distance amounts to twelve  schoines  which one must traverse in this manner. Then you will come to a level plain  in which the Nile flows round an island named Tachompso. (Now in the regions above Elephantine there dwell Ethiopians at once succeeding  who also occupy half of the island  and Egyptians the other half. ) Adjoining this island there is a great lake  round which dwell Ethiopian nomad tribes; and when you have sailed through this you will come to the stream of the Nile again  which flows into this lake. After this you will disembark and make a journey by land of forty days; for in the Nile sharp rocks stand forth out of the water  and there are many reefs  by which it is not possible for a vessel to pass. Then after having passed through this country in the forty days which I have said  you will embark again in another vessel and sail for twelve days; and after this you will come to a great city called Meroe. This city is said to be the mother-city of all the other Ethiopians: and they who dwell in it reverence of the gods Zeus and Dionysos alone  and these they greatly honour; and they have an Oracle of Zeus established  and make warlike marches whensoever this god commands them by prophesyings and to whatsoever place he commands.,mashup

Now the name of theseDeserters is  Asmach  and this word signifies  when translated into the tongue of the Hellenes those who stand on the left hand of the king. These were two hundred and forty thousand Egyptians of the warrior class  who revolted and went over to the Ethiopians for the following cause:— In the reign of Psammetichos garrisons were set  one towards the Ethiopians at the city of Elephantine  another towards the Arabians and Assyrians at Daphnai of Pelusion  and another towards Libya at Marea: and even in my own time the garrisons of the Persians too are ordered in the same manner as these were in the reign of Psammetichos  for both at Elephantine and at Daphnai the Persians have outposts. The Egyptians then of whom I speak had served as outposts for three years and no one relieved them from their guard; accordingly they took counsel together  and adopting a common plan they all in a body revolted from Psammetichos and set out for Ethiopia. Hearing this Psammetichos set forth in pursuit  and when he came up with them he entreated them much and endeavoured to persuade them not to desert the gods of their country and their children and wives: upon which it is said that one of them pointed to his privy member and said that wherever this was  there would they have both children and wives. When these came to Ethiopia they gave themselves over to the king of the Ethiopians; and he rewarded them as follows:— there were certain of the Ethiopians who had come to be at variance with him; and he bade them drive these out and dwell in their land. So since these men settled in the land of the Ethiopians  the Ethiopians have come to be of milder manners  from having learnt the customs of the Egyptians.,mashup

The Nile then  besides that part of its course which is in Egypt  is known as far as a four months' journey by river and land: for that is the number of months which are found by reckoning to be spent in going from Elephantine to theseDeserters: and the river runs from the West and the setting of the sun. But what comes after that no one can clearly say; for this land is desert by reason of the burning heat.,mashup

Thus much however I heard from men of Kyrene  who told me that they had been to the Oracle of Ammon  and had come to speech with Etearchos king of the Ammonians: and it happened that after speaking of other matters they fell to discourse about the Nile and how no one knew the sources of it; and Etearchos said that once there had come to him men of the Nasamonians (this is a Libyan race which dwells in the Syrtis  and also in the land to the East of the Syrtis reaching to no great distance )  and when the Nasamonians came and were asked by him whether they were able to tell him anything more than he knew about the desert parts of Libya  they said that there had been among them certain sons of chief men  who were of unruly disposition; and these when they grew up to be men had devised various other extravagant things and also they had told off by lot five of themselves to go to see the desert parts of Libya and to try whether they could discover more than those who had previously explored furthest: for in those parts of Libya which are by the Northern Sea  beginning from Egypt and going as far as the headland of Soloeis  which is the extreme point of Libya  Libyans (and of them many races ) extend along the whole coast  except so much as the Hellenes and Phenicians hold; but in the upper parts  which lie above the sea-coast and above those people whose land comes down to the sea  Libya is full of wild beasts; and in the parts above the land of wild beasts it is full of sand  terribly waterless and utterly desert. These young men then (said they )  being sent out by their companions well furnished with supplies of water and provisions  went first through the inhabited country  and after they had passed through this they came to the country of wild beasts  and after this they passed through the desert  making their journey towards the West Wind; and having passed through a great tract of sand in many days  they saw at last trees growing in a level place; and having come up to them  they were beginning to pluck the fruit which was upon the trees: but as they began to pluck it  there came upon them small men  of less stature than men of the common size  and these seized them and carried them away; and neither could the Nasamonians understand anything of their speech nor could those who were carrying them off understand anything of the speech of the Nasamonians: and they led them (so it was said ) through very great swamps  and after passing through these they came to a city in which all the men were in size like those who carried them off and in colour of skin black; and by the city ran a great river  which ran from the West towards the sunrising  and in it were seen crocodiles.,mashup

Of the account given by Etearchos the Ammonian let so much suffice as is here said  except that  as the men of Kyrene told me  he alleged that the Nasamonians returned safe home  and that the people to whom they had come were all wizards. Now this river which ran by the city  Etearchos conjectured to be the Nile  and moreover reason compels us to think so; for the Nile flows from Libya and cuts Libya through in the midst  and as I conjecture  judging of what is not known by that which is evident to the view  it starts at a distance from its mouth equal to that of the Ister: for the river Ister begins from the Keltoi and the city of Pyrene and so runs that it divides Europe in the midst (now the Keltoi are outside the Pillars of Heracles and border upon the Kynesians  who dwell furthest towards the sunset of all those who have their dwelling in Europe ); and the Ister ends  having its course through the whole of Europe  by flowing into the Euxine Sea at the place where the Milesians have their settlement of Istria.,mashup

Now the Ister  since it flows through land which is inhabited  is known by the reports of many; but of the sources of the Nile no one can give an account  for the part of Libya through which it flows is uninhabited and desert. About its course however so much as it was possible to learn by the most diligent inquiry has been told; and it runs out into Egypt. Now Egypt lies nearly opposite to the mountain districts of Kilikia; and from thence to Sinope  which lies upon the Euxine Sea  is a journey in the same straight line of five days for a man without encumbrance; and Sinope lies opposite to the place where the Ister runs out into the sea: thus I think that the Nile passes through the whole of Libya and is of equal measure with the Ister. Of the Nile then let so much suffice as has been said.,mashup

Of Egypt however I shall make my report at length  because it has wonders more in number than any other land  and works too it has to show as much as any land  which are beyond expression great: for this reason then more shall be said concerning it. The Egyptians in agreement with their climate  which is unlike any other  and with the river  which shows a nature different from all other rivers  established for themselves manners and customs in a way opposite to other men in almost all matters: for among them the women frequent the market and carry on trade  while the men remain at home and weave; and whereas others weave pushing the woof upwards  the Egyptians push it downwards: the men carry their burdens upon their heads and the women upon their shoulders: the women make water standing up and the men crouching down: they ease themselves in their houses and they eat without in the streets  alleging as reason for this that it is right to do secretly the things that are unseemly though necessary  but those which are not unseemly  in public: no woman is a minister either of male or female divinity  but men of all  both male and female: to support their parents the sons are in no way compelled  if they do not desire to do so  but the daughters are forced to do so  be they never so unwilling.,mashup

They are religious excessively beyond all other men  and with regard to this they have customs as follows:— they drink from cups of bronze and rinse them out every day  and not some only do this but all: they wear garments of linen always newly washed  and this they make a special point of practice: they circumcise themselves for the sake of cleanliness  preferring to be clean rather than comely. The priests shave themselves all over their body every other day  so that no lice or any other foul thing may come to be upon them when they minister to the gods; and the priests wear garments of linen only and sandals of papyrus  and any other garment they may not take nor other sandals; these wash themselves in cold water twice in the day and twice again in the night; and other religious services they perform (one may almost say ) of infinite number. They enjoy also good things not a few  for they do not consume or spend anything of their own substance  but there is sacred bread baked for them and they have each great quantity of flesh of oxen and geese coming in to them each day  and also wine of grapes is given to them; but it is not permitted to them to taste of fish: beans moreover the Egyptians do not at all sow in their land  and those which grow they neither eat raw nor boil for food; nay the priests do not endure even to look upon them  thinking this to be an unclean kind of pulse: and there is not one priest only for each of the gods but many  and of them one is chief- priest  and whenever a priest dies his son is appointed to his place.,mashup

The males of the ox kind they consider to belong to Epaphos  and on account of him they test them in the following manner:— If the priest sees one single black hair upon the beast he counts it not clean for sacrifice; and one of the priests who is appointed for the purpose makes investigation of these matters  both when the beast is standing upright and when it is lying on its back  drawing out its tongue moreover  to see if it is clean in respect of the appointed signs  which I shall tell of in another part of the history: he looks also at the hairs of the tail to see if it has them growing in the natural manner: and if it be clean in respect of all these things  he marks it with a piece of papyrus  rolling this round the horns  and then when he has plastered sealing-earth over it he sets upon it the seal of his signet-ring  and after that they take the animal away. But for one who sacrifices a beast not sealed the penalty appointed is death.,mashup

In this way then the beast is tested; and their appointed manner of sacrifice is as follows:— they lead the sealed beast to the altar where they happen to be sacrificing and then kindle a fire: after that  having poured libations of wine over the altar so that it runs down upon the victim and having called upon the god  they cut its throat  and having cut its throat they sever the head from the body. The body then of the beast they flay  but upon the head they make many imprecations first  and then they who have a market and Hellenes sojourning among them for trade  these carry it to the market-place and sell it  while they who have no Hellenes among them cast it away into the river: and this is the form of imprecation which they utter upon the heads  praying that if any evil be about to befall either themselves who are offering sacrifice or the land of Egypt in general  it may come rather upon this head. Now as regards the heads of the beasts which are sacrificed and the pouring over them of the wine  all the Egyptians have the same customs equally for all their sacrifices; and by reason of this custom none of the Egyptians eat of the head either of this or of any other kind of animal:,mashup

The clean males then of the ox kind  both full-grown animals and calves  are sacrificed by all the Egyptians; the females however they may not sacrifice  but these are sacred to Isis; for the figure of Isis is in the form of a woman with cow's horns  just as the Hellenes present Io in pictures  and all the Egyptians without distinction reverence cows far more than any other kind of cattle; for which reason neither man nor woman of Egyptian race would kiss a man who is a Hellene on the mouth  nor will they use a knife or roasting-spits or a caldron belonging to a Hellene  nor taste of the flesh even of a clean animal if it has been cut with the knife of a Hellene. And the cattle of this kind which die they bury in the following manner:— the females they cast into the river  but the males they bury  each people in the suburb of their town  with one of the horns  or sometimes both  protruding to mark the place; and when the bodies have rotted away and the appointed time comes on  then to each city comes a boat from that which is called the island of Prosopitis (this is in the Delta  and the extent of its circuit is nine  schoines  ). In this island of Prosopitis is situated  besides many other cities  that one from which the boats come to take up the bones of the oxen  and the name of the city is Atarbechis  and in it there is set up a holy temple of Aphrodite. From this city many go abroad in various directions  some to one city and others to another  and when they have dug up the bones of the oxen they carry them off  and coming together they bury them in one single place. In the same manner as they bury the oxen they bury also their other cattle when they die; for about them also they have the same law laid down  and these also they abstain from killing.,mashup

Now all who have a temple set up to the Theban Zeus or who are of the district of Thebes  these  I say  all sacrifice goats and abstain from sheep: for not all the Egyptians equally reverence the same gods  except only Isis and Osiris (who they say is Dionysos )  these they all reverence alike: but they who have a temple of Mendes or belong to the Mendesian district  these abstain from goats and sacrifice sheep. Now the men of Thebes and those who after their example abstain from sheep  say that this custom was established among them for the cause which follows:— Heracles (they say ) had an earnest desire to see Zeus  and Zeus did not desire to be seen of him; and at last when Heracles was urgent in entreaty Zeus contrived this device  that is to say  he flayed a ram and held in front of him the head of the ram which he had cut off  and he put on over him the fleece and then showed himself to him. Hence the Egyptians make the image of Zeus into the face of a ram; and the Ammonians do so also after their example  being settlers both from the Egyptians and from the Ethiopians  and using a language which is a medley of both tongues: and in my opinion it is from this god that the Ammonians took the name which they have  for the Egyptians call Zeus  Amun. The Thebans then do not sacrifice rams but hold them sacred for this reason; on one day however in the year  on the feast of Zeus  they cut up in the same manner and flay one single ram and cover with its skin the image of Zeus  and then they bring up to it another image of Heracles. This done  all who are in the temple beat themselves in lamentation for the ram  and then they bury it in a sacred tomb.,mashup

About Heracles I heard the account given that he was of the number of the twelve gods; but of the other Heracles whom the Hellenes know I was not able to hear in any part of Egypt: and moreover to prove that the Egyptians did not take the name of Heracles from the Hellenes  but rather the Hellenes from the Egyptians — that is to say those of the Hellenes who gave the name Heracles to the son of Amphitryon — of that  I say  besides many other evidences there is chiefly this  namely that the parents of this Heracles  Amphitryon and Alcmene  were both of Egypt by descent  and also that the Egyptians say that they do not know the names either of Poseidon or of the Dioscuroi  nor have these been accepted by them as gods among the other gods; whereas if they had received from the Hellenes the name of any divinity  they would naturally have preserved the memory of these most of all  assuming that in those times as now some of the Hellenes were wont to make voyages and were sea-faring folk  as I suppose and as my judgment compels me to think; so that the Egyptians would have learnt the names of these gods even more than that of Heracles. In fact however Heracles is a very ancient Egyptian god; and (as they say themselves ) it is seventeen thousand years to the beginning of the reign of Amasis from the time when the twelve gods  of whom they count that Heracles is one  were begotten of the eight gods.,mashup

I saw also at Tyre another temple of Heracles  with the surname Thasian; and I came to Thasos also and there I found a temple of Heracles set up by the Phenicians  who had sailed out to seek for Europa and had colonised Thasos; and these things happened full five generations of men before Heracles the son of Amphitryon was born in Hellas. So then my inquiries show clearly that Heracles is an ancient god  and those of the Hellenes seem to me to act most rightly who have two temples of Heracles set up  and who sacrifice to the one as an immortal god and with the title Olympian  and make offerings of the dead to the other as a hero.,mashup

Moreover  besides many other stories which the Hellenes tell without due consideration  this tale is especially foolish which they tell about Heracles  namely that when he came to Egypt  the Egyptians put on him wreaths and led him forth in procession to sacrifice him to Zeus; and he for some time kept quiet  but when they were beginning the sacrifice of him at the altar  he betook himself to prowess and slew them all. I for my part am of opinion that the Hellenes when they tell this tale are altogether without knowledge of the nature and customs of the Egyptians; for how should they for whom it is not lawful to sacrifice even beasts  except swine and the males of oxen and calves (such of them as are clean ) and geese  how should these sacrifice human beings? Besides this  how is it in nature possible that Heracles  being one person only and moreover a man (as they assert )  should slay many myriads? Having said so much of these matters  we pray that we may have grace from both the gods and the heroes for our speech.,mashup

Now the reason why those of the Egyptians whom I have mentioned do not sacrifice goats  female or male  is this:— the Mendesians count Pan to be one of the eight gods (now these eight gods they say came into being before the twelve gods )  and the painters and image-makers represent in painting and in sculpture the figure of Pan  just as the Hellenes do  with goat's face and legs  not supposing him to be really like this but to resemble the other gods; the cause however why they represent him in this form I prefer not to say. The Mendesians then reverence all goats and the males more than the females (and the goatherds too have greater honour than other herdsmen )  but of the goats one especially is reverenced  and when he dies there is great mourning in all the Mendesian district: and both the goat and Pan are called in the Egyptian tongue  Mendes. Moreover in my lifetime there happened in that district this marvel  that is to say a he-goat had intercourse with a woman publicly  and this was so done that all men might have evidence of it.,mashup

The pig is accounted by the Egyptians an abominable animal; and first  if any of them in passing by touch a pig  he goes into the river and dips himself forthwith in the water together with his garments; and then too swineherds  though they be native Egyptians  unlike all others do not enter any of the temples in Egypt  nor is anyone willing to give his daughter in marriage to one of them or to take a wife from among them; but the swineherds both give in marriage to one another and take from one another. Now to the other gods the Egyptians do not think it right to sacrifice swine; but to the Moon and to Dionysos alone at the same time and on the same full-moon they sacrifice swine  and then eat their flesh: and as to the reason why  when they abominate swine at all their other feasts  they sacrifice them at this  there is a story told by the Egyptians; and this story I know  but it is not a seemly one for me to tell. Now the sacrifice of the swine to the Moon is performed as follows:— when the priest has slain the victim  he puts together the end of the tail and the spleen and the caul  and covers them up with the whole of the fat of the animal which is about the paunch  and then he offers them with fire; and the rest of the flesh they eat on that day of full moon upon which they have held the sacrifice  but on any day after this they will not taste of it: the poor however among them by reason of the scantiness of their means shape pigs of dough and having baked them they offer these as a sacrifice.,mashup

Then for Dionysos on the eve of the festival each one kills a pig by cutting its throat before his own doors  and after that he gives the pig to the swineherd who sold it to him  to carry away again; and the rest of the feast of Dionysos is celebrated by the Egyptians in the same way as by the Hellenes in almost all things except choral dances  but instead of the  phallos  they have invented another contrivance  namely figures of about a cubit in height worked by strings  which women carry about the villages  with the privy member made to move and not much less in size than the rest of the body: and a flute goes before and they follow singing the praises of Dionysos. As to the reason why the figure has this member larger than is natural and moves it  though it moves no other part of the body  about this there is a sacred story told.,mashup

Strictly speaking indeed  he when he made it known did not take in the whole  but those wise men who came after him made it known more at large. Melampus then is he who taught of the  phallos  which is carried in procession for Dionysos  and from him the Hellenes learnt to do that which they do. I say then that Melampus being a man of ability contrived for himself an art of divination  and having learnt from Egypt he taught the Hellenes many things  and among them those that concern Dionysos  making changes in some few points of them: for I shall not say that that which is done in worship of the god in Egypt came accidentally to be the same with that which is done among the Hellenes  for then these rites would have been in character with the Hellenic worship and not lately brought in; nor certainly shall I say that the Egyptians took from the Hellenes either this or any other customary observance: but I think it most probable that Melampus learnt the matters concerning Dionysos from Cadmos the Tyrian and from those who came with him from Phenicia to the land which we now call Boeotia.,mashup

Moreover the naming of almost all the gods has come to Hellas from Egypt: for that it has come from the Barbarians I find by inquiry is true  and I am of opinion that most probably it has come from Egypt  because  except in the case of Poseidon and the Dioscuroi (in accordance with that which I have said before )  and also of Hera and Hestia and Themis and the Charites and Nereids  the Egyptians have had the names of all the other gods in their country for all time. What I say here is that which the Egyptians think themselves: but as for the gods whose names they profess that they do not know  these I think received their naming from the Pelasgians  except Poseidon; but about this god the Hellenes learnt from the Libyans  for no people except the Libyans have had the name of Poseidon from the first and have paid honour to this god always. Nor  it may be added  have the Egyptians any custom of worshipping heroes.,mashup

These observances then  and others besides these which I shall mention  the Hellenes have adopted from the Egyptians; but to make  as they do  the images of Hermes with the  phallos  they have learnt not from the Egyptians but from the Pelasgians  the custom having been received by the Athenians first of all the Hellenes and from these by the rest; for just at the time when the Athenians were beginning to rank among the Hellenes  the Pelasgians became dwellers with them in their land  and from this very cause it was that they began to be counted as Hellenes. Whosoever has been initiated in the mysteries of the Cabeiroi  which the Samothrakians perform having received them from the Pelasgians  that man knows the meaning of my speech; for these very Pelasgians who became dwellers with the Athenians used to dwell before that time in Samothrake  and from them the Samothrakians received their mysteries. So then the Athenians were the first of the Hellenes who made the images of Hermes with the  phallos  having learnt from the Pelasgians; and the Pelasgians told a sacred story about it  which is set forth in the mysteries in Samothrake.,mashup

Now the Pelasgians formerly were wont to make all their sacrifices calling upon the gods in prayer  as I know from that which I heard at Dodona  but they gave no title or name to any of them  for they had not yet heard any  but they called them gods ({theous} ) from some such notion as this  that they had set ({thentes} ) in order all things and so had the distribution of everything. Afterwards  when much time had elapsed  they learnt from Egypt the names of the gods  all except Dionysos  for his name they learnt long afterwards; and after a time the Pelasgians consulted the Oracle at Dodona about the names  for this prophetic seat is accounted to be the most ancient of the Oracles which are among the Hellenes  and at that time it was the only one. So when the Pelasgians asked the Oracle at Dodona whether they should adopt the names which had come from the Barbarians  the Oracle in reply bade them make use of the names. From this time they sacrificed using the names of the gods  and from the Pelasgians the Hellenes afterwards received them:,mashup

I however have an opinion about the matter as follows:— If the Phenicians did in truth carry away the consecrated women and sold one of them into Libya and the other into Hellas  I suppose that in the country now called Hellas  which was formerly called Pelasgia  this woman was sold into the land of the Thesprotians; and then being a slave there she set up a sanctuary of Zeus under a real oak-tree; as indeed it was natural that being an attendant of the sanctuary of Zeus at Thebes  she should there  in the place to which she had come  have a memory of him; and after this  when she got understanding of the Hellenic tongue  she established an Oracle  and she reported  I suppose  that her sister had been sold in Libya by the same Phenicians by whom she herself had been sold.,mashup

Moreover  I think that the women were called doves by the people of Dodona for the reason that they were Barbarians and because it seemed to them that they uttered voice like birds; but after a time (they say ) the dove spoke with human voice  that is when the woman began to speak so that they could understand; but so long as she spoke a Barbarian tongue she seemed to them to be uttering voice like a bird: for had it been really a dove  how could it speak with human voice? And in saying that the dove was black  they indicate that the woman was Egyptian. The ways of delivering oracles too at Thebes in Egypt and at Dodona closely resemble one another  as it happens  and also the method of divination by victims has come from Egypt.,mashup

This they do by every city along the river-bank; and when they come to Bubastis they hold festival celebrating great sacrifices  and more wine of grapes is consumed upon that festival than during the whole of the rest of the year.

Moreover those of the Egyptians who have not come to this solemn assembly observe the night of the festival and themselves also light lamps all of them  and thus not in Sais alone are they lighted  but over all Egypt: and as to the reason why light and honour are allotted to this night  about this there is a sacred story told.,mashup

To Heliopolis and Buto they go year by year and do sacrifice only: but at Papremis they do sacrifice and worship as elsewhere  and besides that  when the sun begins to go down  while some few of the priests are occupied with the image of the god  the greater number of them stand in the entrance of the temple with wooden clubs  and other persons to the number of more than a thousand men with purpose to perform a vow  these also having all of them staves of wood  stand in a body opposite to those: and the image  which is in a small shrine of wood covered over with gold  they take out on the day before to another sacred building. The few then who have been left about the image  draw a wain with four wheels  which bears the shrine and the image that is within the shrine  and the other priests standing in the gateway try to prevent it from entering  and the men who are under a vow come to the assistance of the god and strike them  while the others defend themselves. Then there comes to be a hard fight with staves  and they break one another's heads  and I am of opinion that many even die of the wounds they receive; the Egyptians however told me that no one died. This solemn assembly the people of the place say that they established for the following reason:— the mother of Ares  they say  used to dwell in this temple  and Ares  having been brought up away from her  when he grew up came thither desiring to visit his mother  and the attendants of his mother's temple  not having seen him before  did not permit him to pass in  but kept him away; and he brought men to help him from another city and handled roughly the attendants of the temple  and entered to visit his mother. Hence  they say  this exchange of blows has become the custom in honour of Ares upon his festival.,mashup

The Egyptians were the first who made it a point of religion not to lie with women in temples  nor to enter into temples after going away from women without first bathing: for almost all other men except the Egyptians and the Hellenes lie with women in temples and enter into a temple after going away from women without bathing  since they hold that there is no difference in this respect between men and beasts: for they say that they see beasts and the various kinds of birds coupling together both in the temples and in the sacred enclosures of the gods; if then this were not pleasing to the god  the beasts would not do so.,mashup

Thus do these defend that which they do  which by me is disallowed: but the Egyptians are excessively careful in their observances  both in other matters which concern the sacred rites and also in those which follow:— Egypt  though it borders upon Libya  does not very much abound in wild animals  but such as they have are one and all accounted by them sacred  some of them living with men and others not. But if I should say for what reasons the sacred animals have been thus dedicated  I should fall into discourse of matters pertaining to the gods  of which I most desire not to speak; and what I have actually said touching slightly upon them  I said because I was constrained by necessity. About these animals there is a custom of this kind:— persons have been appointed of the Egyptians  both men and women  to provide the food for each kind of beast separately  and their office goes down from father to son; and those who dwell in the various cities perform vows to them thus  that is  when they make a vow to the god to whom the animal belongs  they shave the head of their children either the whole or the half or the third part of it  and then set the hair in the balance against silver  and whatever it weighs  this the man gives to the person who provides for the animals  and she cuts up fish of equal value and gives it for food to the animals. Thus food for their support has been appointed: and if any one kill any of these animals  the penalty  if he do it with his own will  is death  and if against his will  such penalty as the priests may appoint: but whosoever shall kill an ibis or a hawk  whether it be with his will or against his will  must die.,mashup

Of the animals that live with men there are great numbers  and would be many more but for the accidents which befall the cats. For when the females have produced young they are no longer in the habit of going to the males  and these seeking to be united with them are not able. To this end then they contrive as follows — they either take away by force or remove secretly the young from the females and kill them (but after killing they do not eat them )  and the females being deprived of their young and desiring more  therefore come to the males  for it is a creature that is fond of its young. Moreover when a fire occurs  the cats seem to be divinely possessed; for while the Egyptians stand at intervals and look after the cats  not taking any care to extinguish the fire  the cats slipping through or leaping over the men  jump into the fire; and when this happens  great mourning comes upon the Egyptians. And in whatever houses a cat has died by a natural death  all those who dwell in this house shave their eyebrows only  but those in whose houses a dog has died shave their whole body and also their head.,mashup

Of all the mortal creatures of which we have knowledge this grows to the greatest bulk from the smallest beginning; for the eggs which she produces are not much larger than those of geese and the newly-hatched young one is in proportion to the egg  but as he grows he becomes as much as seventeen cubits long and sometimes yet larger. He has eyes like those of a pig and teeth large and tusky  in proportion to the size of his body; but unlike all other beasts he grows no tongue  neither does he move his lower jaw  but brings the upper jaw towards the lower  being in this too unlike all other beasts. He has moreover strong claws and a scaly hide upon his back which cannot be pierced; and he is blind in the water  but in the air he is of very keen sight. Since he has his living in the water he keeps his mouth all full within of leeches; and whereas all other birds and beasts fly from him  the trochilus is a creature which is at peace with him  seeing that from her he receives benefit; for the crocodile having come out of the water to the land and then having opened his mouth (this he is wont to do generally towards the West Wind )  the trochilus upon that enters into his mouth and swallows down the leeches  and he being benefited is pleased and does no harm to the trochilus.,mashup

Now for some of the Egyptians the crocodiles are sacred animals  and for others not so  but they treat them on the contrary as enemies: those however who dwell about Thebes and about the lake of Moiris hold them to be most sacred  and each of these two peoples keeps one crocodile selected from the whole number  which has been trained to tameness  and they put hanging ornaments of molten stone and of gold into the ears of these and anklets round the front feet  and they give them food appointed and victims of sacrifices and treat them as well as possible while they live  and after they are dead they bury them in sacred tombs  embalming them: but those who dwell about the city of Elephantine even eat them  not holding them to be sacred. They are called not crocodiles but  champsai  and the Ionians gave them the name of crocodile  comparing their form to that of the crocodiles (lizards ) which appear in their country in the stone walls.,mashup

A man puts the back of a pig upon a hook as bait  and lets it go into the middle of the river  while he himself upon the bank of the river has a young live pig  which he beats; and the crocodile hearing its cries makes for the direction of the sound  and when he finds the pig's back he swallows it down: then they pull  and when he is drawn out to land  first of all the hunter forthwith plasters up his eyes with mud  and having so done he very easily gets the mastery of him  but if he does not do so he has much trouble.,mashup

There is also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I did not myself see except in painting  for in truth he comes to them very rarely  at intervals  as the people of Heliopolis say  of five hundred years; and these say that he comes regularly when his father dies; and if he be like the painting  he is of this size and nature  that is to say  some of his feathers are of gold colour and others red  and in outline and size he is as nearly as possible like an eagle. This bird they say (but I cannot believe the story ) contrives as follows:— setting forth from Arabia he conveys his father  they say  to the temple of the Sun (Helios ) plastered up in myrrh  and buries him in the temple of the Sun; and he conveys him thus:— he forms first an egg of myrrh as large as he is able to carry  and then he makes trial of carrying it  and when he has made trial sufficiently  then he hollows out the egg and places his father within it and plasters over with other myrrh that part of the egg where he hollowed it out to put his father in  and when his father is laid in it  it proves (they say ) to be of the same weight as it was; and after he has plastered it up  he conveys the whole to Egypt to the temple of the Sun. Thus they say that this bird does.,mashup

There is a region moreover in Arabia  situated nearly over against the city of Buto  to which place I came to inquire about the winged serpents: and when I came thither I saw bones of serpents and spines in quantity so great that it is impossible to make report of the number  and there were heaps of spines  some heaps large and others less large and others smaller still than these  and these heaps were many in number. This region in which the spines are scattered upon the ground is of the nature of an entrance from a narrow mountain pass to a great plain  which plain adjoins the plain of Egypt; and the story goes that at the beginning of spring winged serpents from Arabia fly towards Egypt  and the birds called ibises meet them at the entrance to this country and do not suffer the serpents to go by but kill them. On account of this deed it is (say the Arabians ) that the ibis has come to be greatly honoured by the Egyptians  and the Egyptians also agree that it is for this reason that they honour these birds.,mashup

Of their fish some they dry in the sun and then eat them without cooking  others they eat cured in brine.

This song agrees exactly with that which the Hellenes sing calling on the name of Linos  so that besides many other things about which I wonder among those matters which concern Egypt  I wonder especially about this  namely whence they got the song of Linos. It is evident however that they have sung this song from immemorial time  and in the Egyptian tongue Linos is called Maneros.

In this occupation certain persons employ themselves regularly and inherit this as a craft. These  whenever a corpse is conveyed to them  show to those who brought it wooden models of corpses made like reality by painting  and the best of the ways of embalming they say is that of him whose name I think it impiety to mention when speaking of a matter of such a kind; the second which they show is less good than this and also less expensive; and the third is the least expensive of all. Having told them about this  they inquire of them in which way they desire the corpse of their friend to be prepared. Then they after they have agreed for a certain price depart out of the way  and the others being left behind in the buildings embalm according to the best of these ways thus:— First with a crooked iron tool they draw out the brain through the nostrils  extracting it partly thus and partly by pouring in drugs; and after this with a sharp stone of Ethiopia they make a cut along the side and take out the whole contents of the belly  and when they have cleared out the cavity and cleansed it with palm-wine they cleanse it again with spices pounded up: then they fill the belly with pure myrrh pounded up and with cassia and other spices except frankincense  and sew it together again. Having so done they keep it for embalming covered up in natron for seventy days  but for a longer time than this it is not permitted to embalm it; and when the seventy days are past  they wash the corpse and roll its whole body up in fine linen cut into bands  smearing these beneath with gum  which the Egyptians use generally instead of glue. Then the kinsfolk receive it from them and have a wooden figure made in the shape of a man  and when they have had this made they enclose the corpse  and having shut it up within  they store it then in a sepulchral chamber  setting it to stand upright against the wall.,mashup

Thus they deal with the corpses which are prepared in the most costly way; but for those who desire the middle way and wish to avoid great cost they prepare the corpse as follows:— having filled their syringes with the oil which is got from cedar-wood  with this they forthwith fill the belly of the corpse  and this they do without having either cut it open or taken out the bowels  but they inject the oil by the breech  and having stopped the drench from returning back they keep it then the appointed number of days for embalming  and on the last of the days they let the cedar oil come out from the belly  which they before put in; and it has such power that it brings out with it the bowels and interior organs of the body dissolved; and the natron dissolves the flesh  so that there is left of the corpse only the skin and the bones. When they have done this they give back the corpse at once in that condition without working upon it any more.,mashup

Hellenic usages they will by no means follow  and to speak generally they follow those of no other men whatever. This rule is observed by most of the Egyptians; but there is a large city named Chemmis in the Theban district near Neapolis  and in this city there is a temple of Perseus the son of Danae which is of a square shape  and round it grow date-palms: the gateway of the temple is built of stone and of very great size  and at the entrance of it stand two great statues of stone. Within this enclosure is a temple-house and in it stands an image of Perseus. These people of Chemmis say that Perseus is wont often to appear in their land and often within the temple  and that a sandal which has been worn by him is found sometimes  being in length two cubits  and whenever this appears all Egypt prospers. This they say  and they do in honour of Perseus after Hellenic fashion thus — they hold an athletic contest  which includes the whole list of games  and they offer in prizes cattle and cloaks and skins: and when I inquired why to them alone Perseus was wont to appear  and wherefore they were separated from all the other Egyptians in that they held an athletic contest  they said that Perseus had been born of their city  for Danaos and Lynkeus were men of Chemmis and had sailed to Hellas  and from them they traced a descent and came down to Perseus: and they told me that he had come to Egypt for the reason which the Hellenes also say  namely to bring from Libya the Gorgon's head  and had then visited them also and recognised all his kinsfolk  and they said that he had well learnt the name of Chemmis before he came to Egypt  since he had heard it from his mother  and that they celebrated an athletic contest for him by his own command.,mashup

All these are customs practised by the Egyptians who dwell above the fens: and those who are settled in the fen-land have the same customs for the most part as the other Egyptians  both in other matters and also in that they live each with one wife only  as do the Hellenes; but for economy in respect of food they have invented these things besides:— when the river has become full and the plains have been flooded  there grow in the water great numbers of lilies  which the Egyptians call  lotos; these they cut with a sickle and dry in the sun  and then they pound that which grows in the middle of the lotos and which is like the head of a poppy  and they make of it loaves baked with fire. The root also of this lotos is edible and has a rather sweet taste: it is round in shape and about the size of an apple. There are other lilies too  in flower resembling roses  which also grow in the river  and from them the fruit is produced in a separate vessel springing from the root by the side of the plant itself  and very nearly resembles a wasp's comb: in this there grow edible seeds in great numbers of the size of an olive-stone  and they are eaten either fresh or dried. Besides this they pull up from the fens the papyrus which grows every year  and the upper parts of it they cut off and turn to other uses  but that which is left below for about a cubit in length they eat or sell: and those who desire to have the papyrus at its very best bake it in an oven heated red-hot  and then eat it. Some too of these people live on fish alone  which they dry in the sun after having caught them and taken out the entrails  and then when they are dry  they use them for food.,mashup

Καὶ περὶ μὲν τοὺς ἰχθῦς οὕτως ἔχει. Fish which swim in shoals are not much produced in the rivers  but are bred in the lakes  and they do as follows:— When there comes upon them the desire to breed  they swim out in shoals towards the sea; and the males lead the way shedding forth their milt as they go  while the females  coming after and swallowing it up  from it become impregnated: and when they have become full of young in the sea they swim up back again  each shoal to its own haunts. The same however no longer lead the way as before  but the lead comes now to the females  and they leading the way in shoals do just as the males did  that is to say they shed forth their eggs by a few grains at a time  and the males coming after swallow them up. Now these grains are fish  and from the grains which survive and are not swallowed  the fish grow which afterwards are bred up. Now those of the fish which are caught as they swim out to sea are found to be rubbed on the left side of the head  but those which are caught as they swim up again are rubbed on the right side. This happens to them because as they swim down to the sea they keep close to the land on the left side of the river  and again as they swim up they keep to the same side  approaching and touching the bank as much as they can  for fear doubtless of straying from their course by reason of the stream. When the Nile begins to swell  the hollow places of the land and the depressions by the side of the river first begin to fill  as the water soaks through from the river  and so soon as they become full of water  at once they are all filled with little fishes; and whence these are in all likelihood produced  I think that I perceive. In the preceding year  when the Nile goes down  the fish first lay eggs in the mud and then retire with the last of the retreating waters; and when the time comes round again  and the water once more comes over the land  from these eggs forthwith are produced the fishes of which I speak.,mashup

From this tree they cut pieces of wood about two cubits in length and arrange them like bricks  fastening the boat together by running a great number of long bolts through the two-cubit pieces; and when they have thus fastened the boat together  they lay cross-pieces over the top  using no ribs for the sides; and within they caulk the seams with papyrus. They make one steering-oar for it  which is passed through the bottom of the boat; and they have a mast of acacia and sails of papyrus. These boats cannot sail up the river unless there be a very fresh wind blowing  but are towed from the shore: down-stream however they travel as follows:— they have a door-shaped crate made of tamarisk wood and reed mats sewn together  and also a stone of about two talents weight bored with a hole; and of these the boatman lets the crate float on in front of the boat  fastened with a rope  and the stone drag behind by another rope. The crate then  as the force of the stream presses upon it  goes on swiftly and draws on the  baris  (for so these boats are called )  while the stone dragging after it behind and sunk deep in the water keeps its course straight. These boats they have in great numbers and some of them carry many thousands of talents' burden.,mashup

When the Nile comes over the land  the cities alone are seen rising above the water  resembling more nearly than anything else the islands in the Egean sea; for the rest of Egypt becomes a sea and the cities alone rise above water. Accordingly  whenever this happens  they pass by water not now by the channels of the river but over the midst of the plain: for example  as one sails up from Naucratis to Memphis the passage is then close by the pyramids  whereas the usual passage is not the same even here  but goes by the point of the Delta and the city of Kercasoros; while if you sail over the plain to Naucratis from the sea and from Canobos  you will go by Anthylla and the city called after Archander.,mashup

Hitherto my own observation and judgment and inquiry are the vouchers for that which I have said; but from this point onwards I am about to tell the history of Egypt according to that which I heard  to which will be added also something of that which I have myself seen. Of Min  who first became king of Egypt  the priests said that on the one hand he banked off the site of Memphis from the river: for the whole stream of the river used to flow along by the sandy mountain- range on the side of Libya  but Min formed by embankments that bend of the river which lies to the South about a hundred furlongs above Memphis  and thus he dried up the old stream and conducted the river so that it flowed in the middle between the mountains: and even now this bend of the Nile is by the Persians kept under very careful watch  that it may flow in the channel to which it is confined  and the bank is repaired every year; for if the river should break through and overflow in this direction  Memphis would be in danger of being overwhelmed by flood. When this Min  who first became king  had made into dry land the part which was dammed off  on the one hand  I say  he founded in it that city which is now called Memphis; for Memphis too is in the narrow part of Egypt; and outside the city he dug round it on the North and West a lake communicating with the river  for the side towards the East is barred by the Nile itself. Then secondly he established in the city the temple of Hephaistos a great work and most worthy of mention.,mashup

After this man the priests enumerated to me from a papyrus roll the names of other kings  three hundred and thirty in number; and in all these generations of men eighteen were Ethiopians  one was a woman  a native Egyptian  and the rest were men and of Egyptian race: and the name of the woman who reigned was the same as that of the Babylonian queen  namely Nitocris. Of her they said that desiring to take vengeance for her brother  whom the Egyptians had slain when he was their king and then  after having slain him  had given his kingdom to her — desiring  I say  to take vengeance for him  she destroyed by craft many of the Egyptians. For she caused to be constructed a very large chamber under ground  and making as though she would handsel it but in her mind devising other things  she invited those of the Egyptians whom she knew to have had most part in the murder  and gave a great banquet. Then while they were feasting  she let in the river upon them by a secret conduit of large size. Of her they told no more than this  except that  when this had been accomplished  she threw herself into a room full of embers  in order that she might escape vengeance.,mashup

Therefore passing these by I shall make mention of the king who came after these  whose name was Sesostris. He (the priests said ) first of all set out with ships of war from the Arabian gulf and subdued those who dwelt by the shores of the Erythraian Sea  until as he sailed he came to a sea which could no further be navigated by reason of shoals: then secondly  after he had returned to Egypt  according to the report of the priests he took a great army and marched over the continent  subduing every nation which stood in his way: and those of them whom he found valiant and fighting desperately for their freedom  in their lands he set up pillars which told by inscriptions his own name and the name of his country  and how he had subdued them by his power; but as to those of whose cities he obtained possession without fighting or with ease  on their pillars he inscribed words after the same tenor as he did for the nations which had shown themselves courageous  and in addition he drew upon them the hidden parts of a woman  desiring to signify by this that the people were cowards and effeminate.,mashup

Thus doing he traversed the continent  until at last he passed over to Europe from Asia and subdued the Scythians and also the Thracians. These  I am of opinion  were the furthest people to which the Egyptian army came  for in their country the pillars are found to have been set up  but in the land beyond this they are no longer found. From this point he turned and began to go back; and when he came to the river Phasis  what happened then I cannot say for certain  whether the king Sesostris himself divided off a certain portion of his army and left the men there as settlers in the land  or whether some of his soldiers were wearied by his distant marches and remained by the river Phasis.,mashup

For the people of Colchis are evidently Egyptian  and this I perceived for myself before I heard it from others. So when I had come to consider the matter I asked them both; and the Colchians had remembrance of the Egyptians more than the Egyptians of the Colchians; but the Egyptians said they believed that the Colchians were a portion of the army of Sesostris. That this was so I conjectured myself not only because they are dark-skinned and have curly hair (this of itself amounts to nothing  for there are other races which are so )  but also still more because the Colchians  Egyptians  and Ethiopians alone of all the races of men have practised circumcision from the first. The Phenicians and the Syrians who dwell in Palestine confess themselves that they have learnt it from the Egyptians  and the Syrians about the river Thermodon and the river Parthenios  and the Macronians  who are their neighbours  say that they have learnt it lately from the Colchians. These are the only races of men who practise circumcision  and these evidently practise it in the same manner as the Egyptians. Of the Egyptians themselves however and the Ethiopians  I am not able to say which learnt from the other  for undoubtedly it is a most ancient custom; but that the other nations learnt it by intercourse with the Egyptians  this among others is to me a strong proof  namely that those of the Phenicians who have intercourse with Hellas cease to follow the example of the Egyptians in this matter  and do not circumcise their children.,mashup

The pillars which Sesostris of Egypt set up in the various countries are for the most part no longer to be seen extant; but in Syria Palestine I myself saw them existing with the inscription upon them which I have mentioned and the emblem. Moreover in Ionia there are two figures of this man carved upon rocks  one on the road by which one goes from the land of Ephesos to Phocaia  and the other on the road from Sardis to Smyrna. In each place there is a figure of a man cut in the rock  of four cubits and a span in height  holding in his right hand a spear and in his left a bow and arrows  and the other equipment which he has is similar to this  for it is both Egyptian and Ethiopian: and from the one shoulder to the other across the breast runs an inscription carved in sacred Egyptian characters  saying thus This land with my shoulders I won for myself. But who he is and from whence  he does not declare in these places  though in other places he has declared this.

As this Egyptian Sesostris was returning and bringing back many men of the nations whose lands he had subdued  when he came (said the priests ) to Daphnai in the district of Pelusion on his journey home  his brother to whom Sesostris had entrusted the charge of Egypt invited him and with him his sons to a feast; and then he piled the house round with brushwood and set it on fire: and Sesostris when he discovered this forthwith took counsel with his wife  for he was bringing with him (they said ) his wife also; and she counselled him to lay out upon the pyre two of his sons  which were six in number  and so to make a bridge over the burning mass  and that they passing over their bodies should thus escape. This  they said  Sesostris did  and two of his sons were burnt to death in this manner  but the rest got away safe with their father.,mashup

Then Sesostris  having returned to Egypt and having taken vengeance on his brother  employed the multitude which he had brought in of those whose lands he had subdued  as follows:— these were they who drew the stones which in the reign of this king were brought to the temple of Hephaistos  being of very great size; and also these were compelled to dig all the channels which now are in Egypt; and thus (having no such purpose ) they caused Egypt  which before was all fit for riding and driving  to be no longer fit for this from thenceforth: for from that time forward Egypt  though it is plain land  has become all unfit for riding and driving  and the cause has been these channels  which are many and run in all directions. But the reason why the king cut up the land was this  namely because those of the Egyptians who had their cities not on the river but in the middle of the country  being in want of water when the river went down from them  found their drink brackish because they had it from wells.,mashup

For this reason Egypt was cut up; and they said that this king distributed the land to all the Egyptians  giving an equal square portion to each man  and from this he made his revenue  having appointed them to pay a certain rent every year: and if the river should take away anything from any man's portion  he would come to the king and declare that which had happened  and the king used to send men to examine and to find out by measurement how much less the piece of land had become  in order that for the future the man might pay less  in proportion to the rent appointed: and I think that thus the art of geometry was found out and afterwards came into Hellas also. For as touching the sun-dial and the gnomon and the twelve divisions of the day  they were learnt by the Hellenes from the Babylonians.,mashup

Now after Sesostris had brought his life to an end  his son Pheros  they told me  received in succession the kingdom  and he made no warlike expedition  and moreover it chanced to him to become blind by reason of the following accident:— when the river had come down in flood rising to a height of eighteen cubits  higher than ever before that time  and had gone over the fields  a wind fell upon it and the river became agitated by waves: and this king (they say ) moved by presumptuous folly took a spear and cast it into the midst of the eddies of the stream; and immediately upon this he had a disease of the eyes and was by it made blind. For ten years then he was blind  and in the eleventh year there came to him an oracle from the city of Buto saying that the time of his punishment had expired  and that he should see again if he washed his eyes with the water of a woman who had accompanied with her own husband only and had not knowledge of other men: and first he made trial of his own wife  and then  as he continued blind  he went on to try all the women in turn; and when he had at last regained his sight he gathered together all the women of whom he had made trial  excepting her by whose means he had regained his sight  to one city which now is named Erythrabolos  and having gathered them to this he consumed them all by fire  as well as the city itself; but as for her by whose means he had regained his sight  he had her himself to wife. Then after he had escaped the malady of his eyes he dedicated offerings at each one of the temples which were of renown  and especially (to mention only that which is most worthy of mention ) he dedicated at the temple of the Sun works which are worth seeing  namely two obelisks of stone  each of a single block  measuring in length a hundred cubits each one and in breadth eight cubits.,mashup

After him  they said  there succeeded to the throne a man of Memphis  whose name in the tongue of the Hellenes was Proteus; for whom there is now a sacred enclosure at Memphis  very fair and well ordered  lying on that side of the temple of Hephaistos which faces the North Wind. Round about this enclosure dwell Phenicians of Tyre  and this whole region is called the Camp of the Tyrians. Within the enclosure of Proteus there is a temple called the temple of theforeign Aphrodite  which temple I conjecture to be one of Helen the daughter of Tyndareus  not only because I have heard the tale how Helen dwelt with Proteus  but also especially because it is called by the name of theforeign Aphrodite  for the other temples of Aphrodite which there are have none of them the addition of the wordforeign to the name.,mashup

And the priests told me  when I inquired  that the things concerning Helen happened thus:— Alexander having carried off Helen was sailing away from Sparta to his own land  and when he had come to the Egean Sea contrary winds drove him from his course to the Sea of Egypt; and after that  since the blasts did not cease to blow  he came to Egypt itself  and in Egypt to that which is now named the Canobic mouth of the Nile and to Taricheiai. Now there was upon the shore  as still there is now  a temple of Heracles  in which if any man's slave take refuge and have the sacred marks set upon him  giving himself over to the god  it is not lawful to lay hands upon him; and this custom has continued still unchanged from the beginning down to my own time. Accordingly the attendants of Alexander  having heard of the custom which existed about the temple  ran away from him  and sitting down as suppliants of the god  accused Alexander  because they desired to do him hurt  telling the whole tale how things were about Helen and about the wrong done to Menelaos; and this accusation they made not only to the priests but also to the warden of this river-mouth  whose name was Thonis.,mashup

Thonis then having heard their tale sent forthwith a message to Proteus at Memphis  which said as follows:There hath come a stranger  a Teucrian by race  who hath done in Hellas an unholy deed; for he hath deceived the wife of his own host  and is come hither bringing with him this woman herself and very much wealth  having been carried out of his way by winds to thy land. Shall we then allow him to sail out unharmed  or shall we first take away from him that which he brought with him ?

So when all had been conveyed up thither  Proteus began to ask Alexander who he was and from whence he was voyaging; and he both recounted to him his descent and told him the name of his native land  and moreover related of his voyage  from whence he was sailing. After this Proteus asked him whence he had taken Helen; and when Alexander went astray in his account and did not speak the truth  those who had become suppliants convicted him of falsehood  relating in full the whole tale of the wrong done. At length Proteus declared to them this sentence  saying Were it not that I count it a matter of great moment not to slay any of those strangers who being driven from their course by winds have come to my land hitherto  I should have taken vengeance on thee on behalf of the man of Hellas  seeing that thou  most base of men  having received from him hospitality  didst work against him a most impious deed. For thou didst go in to the wife of thine own host; and even this was not enough for thee  but thou didst stir her up with desire and hast gone away with her like a thief. Moreover not even this by itself was enough for thee  but thou art come hither with plunder taken from the house of thy host. Now therefore depart  seeing that I have counted it of great moment not to be a slayer of strangers. This woman indeed and the wealth which thou hast I will not allow thee to carry away  but I shall keep them safe for the Hellene who was thy host  until he come himself and desire to carry them off to his home; to thyself however and thy fellow-voyagers I proclaim that ye depart from your anchoring within three days and go from my land to some other; and if not  that ye will be dealt with as enemies.,mashup

This the priests said was the manner of Helen's coming to Proteus; and I suppose that Homer also had heard this story  but since it was not so suitable to the composition of his poem as the other which he followed  he dismissed it finally  making it clear at the same time that he was acquainted with that story also: and according to the manner in which he described the wanderings of Alexander in the Iliad (nor did he elsewhere retract that which he had said ) it is clear that when he brought Helen he was carried out of his course  wandering to various lands  and that he came among other places to Sidon in Phenicia. Of this the poet has made mention in theprowess of Diomede  and the verses run this:There she had robes many-coloured  the works of women of Sidon  Those whom her son himself the god-like of form Alexander Carried from Sidon  what time the broad sea-path he sailed over Bringing back Helene home  of a noble father begotten. And in the Odyssey also he has made mention of it in these verses:Such had the daughter of Zeus  such drugs of exquisite cunning  Good  which to her the wife of Thon  Polydamna  had given  Dwelling in Egypt  the land where the bountiful meadow produces Drugs more than all lands else  many good being mixed  many evil. And thus too Menelaos says to Telemachos:Still the gods stayed me in Egypt  to come back hither desiring  Stayed me from voyaging home  since sacrifice was due I performed not. In these lines he makes it clear that he knew of the wandering of Alexander to Egypt  for Syria borders upon Egypt and the Phenicians  of whom is Sidon  dwell in Syria.,mashup

By these lines and by this passage it is also most clearly shown that theCyprian Epic was not written by Homer but by some other man: for in this it is said that on the third day after leaving Sparta Alexander came to Ilion bringing with him Helen  having had agently-blowing wind and a smooth sea  whereas in the Iliad it says that he wandered from his course when he brought her.,mashup

Let us now leave Homer and theCyprian Epic; but this I will say  namely that I asked the priests whether it is but an idle tale which the Hellenes tell of that which they say happened about Ilion; and they answered me thus  saying that they had their knowledge by inquiries from Menelaos himself. After the rape of Helen there came indeed  they said  to the Teucrian land a large army of Hellenes to help Menelaos; and when the army had come out of the ships to land and had pitched its camp there  they sent messengers to Ilion  with whom went also Menelaos himself; and when these entered within the wall they demanded back Helen and the wealth which Alexander had stolen from Menelaos and had taken away; and moreover they demanded satisfaction for the wrongs done: and the Teucrians told the same tale then and afterwards  both with oath and without oath  namely that in deed and in truth they had not Helen nor the wealth for which demand was made  but that both were in Egypt; and that they could not justly be compelled to give satisfaction for that which Proteus the king of Egypt had. The Hellenes however thought that they were being mocked by them and besieged the city  until at last they took it; and when they had taken the wall and did not find Helen  but heard the same tale as before  then they believed the former tale and sent Menelaos himself to Proteus.,mashup

And Menelaos having come to Egypt and having sailed up to Memphis  told the truth of these matters  and not only found great entertainment  but also received Helen unhurt  and all his own wealth besides. Then however  after he had been thus dealt with  Menelaos showed himself ungrateful to the Egyptians; for when he set forth to sail away  contrary winds detained him  and as this condition of things lasted long  he devised an impious deed; for he took two children of natives and made sacrifice of them. After this  when it was known that he had done so  he became abhorred  and being pursued he escaped and got away in his ships to Libya; but whither he went besides after this  the Egyptians were not able to tell. Of these things they said that they found out part by inquiries  and the rest  namely that which happened in their own land  they related from sure and certain knowledge.,mashup

Καὶ ταῦτα μὲν τῇ ἐμοὶ δοκέει εἴρηται. Thus the priests of the Egyptians told me; and I myself also agree with the story which was told of Helen  adding this consideration  namely that if Helen had been in Ilion she would have been given up to the Hellenes  whether Alexander consented or no; for Priam assuredly was not so mad  nor yet the others of his house  that they were desirous to run risk of ruin for themselves and their children and their city  in order that Alexander might have Helen as his wife: and even supposing that during the first part of the time they had been so inclined  yet when many others of the Trojans besides were losing their lives as often as they fought with the Hellenes  and of the sons of Priam himself always two or three or even more were slain when a battle took place (if one may trust at all to the Epic poets ) — when  I say  things were coming thus to pass  I consider that even if Priam himself had had Helen as his wife  he would have given her back to the Achaians  if at least by so doing he might be freed from the evils which oppressed him. Nor even was the kingdom coming to Alexander next  so that when Priam was old the government was in his hands; but Hector  who was both older and more of a man than he  would have received it after the death of Priam; and him it behoved not to allow his brother to go on with his wrong-doing  considering that great evils were coming to pass on his account both to himself privately and in general to the other Trojans. In truth however they lacked the power to give Helen back; and the Hellenes did not believe them  though they spoke the truth; because  as I declare my opinion  the divine power was purposing to cause them utterly to perish  and so make it evident to men that for great wrongs great also are the chastisements which come from the gods. And thus have I delivered my opinion concerning these matters.,mashup

(a ) This king  they said  got great wealth of silver  which none of the kings born after him could surpass or even come near to; and wishing to store his wealth in safety he caused to be built a chamber of stone  one of the walls whereof was towards the outside of his palace: and the builder of this  having a design against it  contrived as follows  that is  he disposed one of the stones in such a manner that it could be taken out easily from the wall either by two men or even by one. So when the chamber was finished  the king stored his money in it  and after some time the builder  being near the end of his life  called to him his sons (for he had two ) and to them he related how he had contrived in building the treasury of the king  and all in forethought for them  that they might have ample means of living. And when he had clearly set forth to them everything concerning the taking out of the stone  he gave them the measurements  saying that if they paid heed to this matter they would be stewards of the king's treasury. So he ended his life  and his sons made no long delay in setting to work  but went to the palace by night  and having found the stone in the wall of the chamber they dealt with it easily and carried forth for themselves great quantity of the wealth within. (b ) And the king happening to open the chamber  he marvelled when he saw the vessels falling short of the full amount  and he did not know on whom he should lay the blame  since the seals were unbroken and the chamber had been close shut; but when upon his opening the chamber a second and a third time the money was each time seen to be diminished  for the thieves did not slacken in their assaults upon it  he did as follows:— having ordered traps to be made he set these round about the vessels in which the money was; and when the thieves had come as at former times and one of them had entered  then so soon as he came near to one of the vessels he was straightway caught in the trap: and when he perceived in what evil case he was  straightway calling his brother he showed him what the matter was  and bade him enter as quickly as possible and cut off his head  for fear lest being seen and known he might bring about the destruction of his brother also. And to the other it seemed that he spoke well  and he was persuaded and did so; and fitting the stone into its place he departed home bearing with him the head of his brother. (c ) Now when it became day  the king entered into the chamber and was very greatly amazed  seeing the body of the thief held in the trap without his head  and the chamber unbroken  with no way to come in or go out: and being at a loss he hung up the dead body of the thief upon the wall and set guards there  with charge if they saw any one weeping or bewailing himself to seize him and bring him before the king. And when the dead body had been hung up  the mother was greatly grieved  and speaking with the son who survived she enjoined him  in whatever way he could  to contrive means by which he might take down and bring home the body of his dead brother; and if he should neglect to do this  she earnestly threatened that she would go and give information to the king that he had the money. (d ) So as the mother dealt hardly with the surviving son  and he though saying many things to her did not persuade her  he contrived for his purpose a device as follows:— Providing himself with asses he filled some skins with wine and laid them upon the asses  and after that he drove them along: and when he came opposite to those who were guarding the corpse hung up  he drew towards him two or three of the necks of the skins and loosened the cords with which they were tied. Then when the wine was running out  he began to beat his head and cry out loudly  as if he did not know to which of the asses he should first turn; and when the guards saw the wine flowing out in streams  they ran together to the road with drinking vessels in their hands and collected the wine that was poured out  counting it so much gain; and he abused them all violently  making as if he were angry  but when the guards tried to appease him  after a time he feigned to be pacified and to abate his anger  and at length he drove his asses out of the road and began to set their loads right. Then more talk arose among them  and one or two of them made jests at him and brought him to laugh with them; and in the end he made them a present of one of the skins in addition to what they had. Upon that they lay down there without more ado  being minded to drink  and they took him into their company and invited him to remain with them and join them in their drinking: so he (as may be supposed ) was persuaded and stayed. Then as they in their drinking bade him welcome in a friendly manner  he made a present to them also of another of the skins; and so at length having drunk liberally the guards became completely intoxicated; and being overcome by sleep they went to bed on the spot where they had been drinking. He then  as it was now far on in the night  first took down the body of his brother  and then in mockery shaved the right cheeks of all the guards; and after that he put the dead body upon the asses and drove them away home  having accomplished that which was enjoined him by his mother. (e ) Upon this the king  when it was reported to him that the dead body of the thief had been stolen away  displayed great anger; and desiring by all means that it should be found out who it might be who devised these things  did this (so at least they said  but I do not believe the account ) — he caused his own daughter to sit in the stews  and enjoined her to receive all equally  and before having commerce with any one to compel him to tell her what was the most cunning and what the most unholy deed which had been done by him in all his life-time; and whosoever should relate that which had happened about the thief  him she must seize and not let him go out. Then as she was doing that which was enjoined by her father  the thief  hearing for what purpose this was done and having a desire to get the better of the king in resource  did thus:— from the body of one lately dead he cut off the arm at the shoulder and went with it under his mantle: and having gone in to the daughter of the king  and being asked that which the others also were asked  he related that he had done the most unholy deed when he cut off the head of his brother  who had been caught in a trap in the king's treasure-chamber  and the most cunning deed in that he made drunk the guards and took down the dead body of his brother hanging up; and she when she heard it tried to take hold of him  but the thief held out to her in the darkness the arm of the corpse  which she grasped and held  thinking that she was holding the arm of the man himself; but the thief left it in her hands and departed  escaping through the door. (f ) Now when this also was reported to the king  he was at first amazed at the ready invention and daring of the fellow  and then afterwards he sent round to all the cities and made proclamation granting a free pardon to the thief  and also promising a great reward if he would come into his presence. The thief accordingly trusting to the proclamation came to the king  and Rhampsinitos greatly marvelled at him  and gave him this daughter of his to wife  counting him to be the most knowing of all men; for as the Egyptians were distinguished from all other men  so was he from the other Egyptians.,mashup

After these things they said this king went down alive to that place which by the Hellenes is called Hades  and there played at dice with Demeter  and in some throws he overcame her and in others he was overcome by her; and he came back again having as a gift from her a handkerchief of gold: and they told me that because of the going down of Rhampsinitos the Egyptians after he came back celebrated a feast  which I know of my own knowledge also that they still observe even to my time; but whether it is for this cause that they keep the feast or for some other  I am not able to say. However  the priests weave a robe completely on the very day of the feast  and forthwith they bind up the eyes of one of them with a fillet  and having led him with the robe to the way by which one goes to the temple of Demeter  they depart back again themselves. This priest  they say  with his eyes bound up is led by two wolves to the temple of Demeter  which is distant from the city twenty furlongs  and then afterwards the wolves lead him back again from the temple to the same spot.,mashup

Now as to the tales told by the Egyptians  any man may accept them to whom such things appear credible; as for me  it is to be understood throughout the whole of the history that I write by hearsay that which is reported by the people in each place. The Egyptians say that Demeter and Dionysos are rulers of the world below; and the Egyptians are also the first who reported the doctrine that the soul of man is immortal  and that when the body dies  the soul enters into another creature which chances then to be coming to the birth  and when it has gone the round of all the creatures of land and sea and of the air  it enters again into a human body as it comes to the birth; and that it makes this round in a period of three thousand years. This doctrine certain Hellenes adopted  some earlier and some later  as if it were of their own invention  and of these men I know the names but I abstain from recording them.,mashup

Down to the time when Rhampsinitos was king  they told me there was in Egypt nothing but orderly rule  and Egypt prospered greatly; but after him Cheops became king over them and brought them to every kind of evil: for he shut up all the temples  and having first kept them from sacrificing there  he then bade all the Egyptians work for him. So some were appointed to draw stones from the stone-quarries in the Arabian mountains to the Nile  and others he ordered to receive the stones after they had been carried over the river in boats  and to draw them to those which are called the Libyan mountains; and they worked by a hundred thousand men at a time  for each three months continually. Of this oppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by which they drew the stones  which causeway they built  and it is a work not much less  as it appears to me  than the pyramid; for the length of it is five furlongs and the breadth ten fathoms and the height  where it is highest  eight fathoms  and it is made of stone smoothed and with figures carved upon it. For this  they said  the ten years were spent  and for the underground chambers on the hill upon which the pyramids stand  which he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for himself in an island  having conducted thither a channel from the Nile. For the making of the pyramid itself there passed a period of twenty years; and the pyramid is square  each side measuring eight hundred feet  and the height of it is the same.

However that may be  the highest parts of it were finished first  and afterwards they proceeded to finish that which came next to them  and lastly they finished the parts of it near the ground and the lowest ranges. On the pyramid it is declared in Egyptian writing how much was spent on radishes and onions and leeks for the workmen  and if I rightly remember that which the interpreter said in reading to me this inscription  a sum of one thousand six hundred talents of silver was spent; and if this is so  how much besides is likely to have been expended upon the iron with which they worked  and upon bread and clothing for the workmen  seeing that they were building the works for the time which has been mentioned and were occupied for no small time besides  as I suppose  in the cutting and bringing of the stones and in working at the excavation under the ground?,mashup

This king followed the same manner as the other  both in all the rest and also in that he made a pyramid  not indeed attaining to the measurements of that which was built by the former (this I know  having myself also measured it )  and moreover there are no underground chambers beneath nor does a channel come from the Nile flowing to this one as to the other  in which the water coming through a conduit built for it flows round an island within  where they say that Cheops himself is laid: but for a basement he built the first course of Ethiopian stone of divers colours; and this pyramid he made forty feet lower than the other as regards size  building it close to the great pyramid. These stand both upon the same hill  which is about a hundred feet high. And Chephren they said reigned fifty and six years.,mashup

After him  they said  Mykerinos became king over Egypt  who was the son of Cheops; and to him his father's deeds were displeasing  and he both opened the temples and gave liberty to the people  who were ground down to the last extremity of evil  to return to their own business and to their sacrifices;: also he gave decisions of their causes juster than those of all the other kings besides. In regard to this then they commend this king more than all the other kings who had arisen in Egypt before him; for he not only gave good decisions  but also when a man complained of the decision  he gave him recompense from his own goods and thus satisfied his desire. But while Mykerinos was acting mercifully to his subjects and practising this conduct which has been said  calamities befell him  of which the first was this  namely that his daughter died  the only child whom he had in his house: and being above measure grieved by that which had befallen him  and desiring to bury his daughter in a manner more remarkable than others  he made a cow of wood  which he covered over with gold  and then within it he buried this daughter who  as I said  had died.,mashup

In thus saying they speak idly  as it seems to me  especially in what they say about the hands of the statues; for as to this  even we ourselves saw that their hands had dropped off from lapse of time  and they were to be seen still lying at their feet even down to my time.,mashup

After the misfortune of his daughter it happened  they said  secondly to this king as follows:— An oracle came to him from the city of Buto  saying that he was destined to live but six years more  in the seventh year to end his life: and he being indignant at it sent to the Oracle a reproach against the god  making complaint in reply that whereas his father and uncle  who had shut up the temples and had not only not remembered the gods  but also had been destroyers of men  had lived for a long time  he himself  who practised piety  was destined to end his life so soon: and from the Oracle there came a second message  which said that it was for this very cause that he was bringing his life to a swift close; for he had not done that which it was appointed for him to do  since it was destined that Egypt should suffer evils for a hundred and fifty years  and the two kings who had risen before him had perceived this  but he had not. Mykerinos having heard this  and considering that this sentence had been passed upon him beyond recall  procured many lamps  and whenever night came on he lighted these and began to drink and take his pleasure  ceasing neither by day nor by night; and he went about to the fen-country and to the woods and wherever he heard there were the most suitable places for enjoyment. This he devised (having a mind to prove that the Oracle spoke falsely ) in order that he might have twelve years of life instead of six  the nights being turned into days.,mashup

This king also left behind him a pyramid  much smaller than that of his father  of a square shape and measuring on each side three hundred feet lacking twenty  built moreover of Ethiopian stone up to half the height. This pyramid some of the Hellenes say was built by the courtesan Rhodopis  not therein speaking rightly: and besides this it is evident to me that they who speak thus do not even know who Rhodopis was  for otherwise they would not have attributed to her the building of a pyramid like this  on which have been spent (so to speak ) innumerable thousands of talents: moreover they do not know that Rhodopis flourished in the reign of Amasis  and not in this king's reign; for Rhodopis lived very many years later than the kings who left behind the pyramids. By descent she was of Thrace  and she was a slave of Iadmon the son of Hephaistopolis a Samian  and a fellow-slave of Esop the maker of fables; for he too was once the slave of Iadmon  as was proved especially in this fact  namely that when the people of Delphi repeatedly made proclamation in accordance with an oracle  to find some one who would take up the blood- money for the death of Esop  no one else appeared  but at length the grandson of Iadmon  called Iadmon also  took it up; and thus it is shown that Esop too was the slave of Iadmon.,mashup

As for Rhodopis  she came to Egypt brought by Xanthes the Samian  and having come thither to exercise her calling she was redeemed from slavery for a great sum by a man of Mytilene  Charaxos son of Scamandronymos and brother of Sappho the lyric poet. Thus was Rhodopis set free  and she remained in Egypt and by her beauty won so much liking that she made great gain of money for one like Rhodopis  though not enough to suffice for the cost of such a pyramid as this. In truth there is no need to ascribe to her very great riches  considering that the tithe of her wealth may still be seen even to this time by any one who desires it: for Rhodopis wished to leave behind her a memorial of herself in Hellas  namely to cause a thing to be made such as happens not to have been thought of or dedicated in a temple by any besides  and to dedicate this at Delphi as a memorial of herself. Accordingly with the tithe of her wealth she caused to be made spits of iron of size large enough to pierce a whole ox  and many in number  going as far therein as her tithe allowed her  and she sent them to Delphi: these are even at the present time lying there  heaped all together behind the altar which the Chians dedicated  and just opposite to the cell of the temple. Now at Naucratis  as it happens  the courtesans are rather apt to win credit; for this woman first  about whom the story to which I refer is told  became so famous that all the Hellenes without exception come to know the name of Rhodopis  and then after her one whose name was Archidiche became a subject of song over all Hellas  though she was less talked of than the other. As for Charaxos  when after redeeming Rhodopis he returned back to Mytilene  Sappho in an ode violently abused him. Of Rhodopis then I shall say no more.,mashup

In this king's reign they told me that  as the circulation of money was very slow  a law was made for the Egyptians that a man might have that money lent to him which he needed  by offering as security the dead body of his father; and there was added moreover to this law another  namely that he who lent the money should have a claim also to the whole sepulchral chamber belonging to him who received it  and that the man who offered that security should be subject to this penalty  if he refused to pay back the debt  namely that neither the man himself should be allowed to have burial when he died  either in that family burial-place or in any other  nor should he be allowed to bury any one of his kinsmen whom he lost by death. This king desiring to surpass the kings of Egypt who had arisen before him left as a memorial of himself a pyramid which he made of bricks  and on it there is an inscription carved in stone and saying thus:Despise not me in comparison with the pyramids of stone  seeing that I excel them as much as Zeus excels the other gods; for with a pole they struck into the lake  and whatever of the mud attached itself to the pole  this they gathered up and made bricks  and in such manner they finished me.

In his reign the Ethiopians and Sabacos the king of the Ethiopians marched upon Egypt with a great host of men; so this blind man departed  flying to the fen-country  and the Ethiopian was king over Egypt for fifty years  during which he performed deeds as follows:— whenever any man of the Egyptians committed any transgression  he would never put him to death  but he gave sentence upon each man according to the greatness of the wrong-doing  appointing them work at throwing up an embankment before that city from whence each man came of those who committed wrong. Thus the cities were made higher still than before; for they were embanked first by those who dug the channels in the reign of Sesostris  and then secondly in the reign of the Ethiopian  and thus they were made very high: and while other cities in Egypt also stood high  I think in the town at Bubastis especially the earth was piled up. In this city there is a temple very well worthy of mention  for though there are other temples which are larger and built with more cost  none more than this is a pleasure to the eyes. Now Bubastis in the Hellenic tongue is Artemis ,mashup

This temple is in the middle of the city and is looked down upon from all sides as one goes round  for since the city has been banked up to a height  while the temple has not been moved from the place where it was at the first built  it is possible to look down into it: and round it runs a stone wall with figures carved upon it  while within it there is a grove of very large trees planted round a large temple-house  within which is the image of the goddess: and the breadth and length of the temple is a furlong every way. Opposite the entrance there is a road paved with stone for about three furlongs  which leads through the market-place towards the East  with a breadth of about four hundred feet; and on this side and on that grow trees of height reaching to heaven: and the road leads to the temple of Hermes. This temple then is thus ordered.,mashup

The final deliverance from the Ethiopian came about (they said ) as follows:— he fled away because he had seen in his sleep a vision  in which it seemed to him that a man came and stood by him and counselled him to gather together all the priests of Egypt and cut them asunder in the midst. Having seen this dream  he said that it seemed to him that the gods were foreshowing him this to furnish an occasion against him  in order that he might do an impious deed with respect to religion  and so receive some evil either from the gods or from men: he would not however do so  but in truth (he said ) the time had expired  during which it had been prophesied to him that he should rule Egypt before he departed thence. For when he was in Ethiopia the Oracles which the Ethiopians consult had told him that it was fated for him to rule Egypt fifty years: since then this time was now expiring  and the vision of the dream also disturbed him  Sabacos departed out of Egypt of his own free will.,mashup

After him there came to the throne the priest of Hephaistos  whose name was Sethos. This man  they said  neglected and held in no regard the warrior class of the Egyptians  considering that he would have no need of them; and besides other slights which he put upon them  he also took from them the yokes of corn-land which had been given to them as a special gift in the reigns of the former kings  twelve yokes to each man. After this  Sanacharib king of the Arabians and of the Assyrians marched a great host against Egypt. Then the warriors of the Egyptians refused to come to the rescue  and the priest  being driven into a strait  entered into the sanctuary of the temple and bewailed to the image of the god the danger which was impending over him; and as he was thus lamenting  sleep came upon him  and it seemed to him in his vision that the god came and stood by him and encouraged him  saying that he should suffer no evil if he went forth to meet the army of the Arabians; for he himself would send him helpers. Trusting in these things seen in sleep  he took with him  they said  those of the Egyptians who were willing to follow him  and encamped in Pelusion  for by this way the invasion came: and not one of the warrior class followed him  but shop-keepers and artisans and men of the market. Then after they came  there swarmed by night upon their enemies mice of the fields  and ate up their quivers and their bows  and moreover the handles of their shields  so that on the next day they fled  and being without defence of arms great numbers fell. And at the present time this king stands in the temple of Hephaistos in stone  holding upon his hand a mouse  and by letters inscribed he says these words:Let him who looks upon me learn to fear the gods.,mashup

Thus in the period of eleven thousand three hundred and forty years they said that there had arisen no god in human form; nor even before that time or afterwards among the remaining kings who arose in Egypt  did they report that anything of that kind had come to pass. In this time they said that the sun had moved four times from his accustomed place of rising  and where he now sets he had thence twice had his rising  and in the place from whence he now rises he had twice had his setting; and in the meantime nothing in Egypt had been changed from its usual state  neither that which comes from the earth nor that which comes to them from the river nor that which concerns diseases or deaths.,mashup

And formerly when Hecataios the historian was in Thebes  and had traced his descent and connected his family with a god in the sixteenth generation before  the priests of Zeus did for him much the same as they did for me (though I had not traced my descent ). They led me into the sanctuary of the temple  which is of great size  and they counted up the number  showing colossal wooden statues in number the same as they said; for each chief-priest there sets up in his lifetime an image of himself: accordingly the priests  counting and showing me these  declared to me that each one of them was a son succeeding his own father  and they went up through the series of images from the image of the one who had died last  until they had declared this of the whole number. And when Hecataios had traced his descent and connected his family with a god in the sixteenth generation  they traced a descent in opposition to this  besides their numbering  not accepting it from him that a man had been born from a god; and they traced their counter-descent thus  saying that each one of the statues had been  piromis  son of  piromis  until they had declared this of the whole three hundred and forty-five statues  each one being surnamed  piromis; and neither with a god nor a hero did they connect their descent.

Among the Hellenes Heracles and Dionysos and Pan are accounted the latest-born of the gods; but with the Egyptians Pan is a very ancient god  and he is one of those which are called the eight gods  while Heracles is of the second rank  who are called the twelve gods  and Dionysos is of the third rank  namely of those who were born of the twelve gods. Now as to Heracles I have shown already how many years old he is according to the Egyptians themselves  reckoning down to the reign of Amasis  and Pan is said to have existed for yet more years than these  and Dionysos for the smallest number of years as compared with the others; and even for this last they reckon down to the reign of Amasis fifteen thousand years. This the Egyptians say that they know for a certainty  since they always kept a reckoning and wrote down the years as they came. Now the Dionysos who is said to have been born of Semele the daughter of Cadmos  was born about sixteen hundred years before my time  and Heracles who was the son of Alcmene  about nine hundred years  and that Pan who was born of Penelope  for of her and of Hermes Pan is said by the Hellenes to have been born  came into being later than the wars of Troy  about eight hundred years before my time.,mashup

Of these two accounts every man may adopt that one which he shall find the more credible when he hears it. I however  for my part  have already declared my opinion about them. For if these also  like Heracles the son of Amphitryon  had appeared before all men's eyes and had lived their lives to old age in Hellas  I mean Dionysos the son of Semele and Pan the son of Penelope  then one would have said that these also had been born mere men  having the names of those gods who had come into being long before: but as it is  with regard to Dionysos the Hellenes say that as soon as he was born Zeus sewed him up in his thigh and carried him to Nysa  which is above Egypt in the land of Ethiopia; and as to Pan  they cannot say whither he went after he was born. Hence it has become clear to me that the Hellenes learnt the names of these gods later than those of the other gods  and trace their descent as if their birth occurred at the time when they first learnt their names. Thus far then the history is told by the Egyptians themselves;,mashup

Being set free after the reign of the priest of Hephaistos  the Egyptians  since they could not live any time without a king  set up over them twelve kings  having divided all Egypt into twelve parts. These made intermarriages with one another and reigned  making agreement that they would not put down one another by force  nor seek to get an advantage over one another  but would live in perfect friendship: and the reason why they made these agreements  guarding them very strongly from violation  was this  namely that an oracle had been given to them at first when they began to exercise their rule  that he of them who should pour a libation with a bronze cup in the temple of Hephaistos  should be king of all Egypt (for they used to assemble together in all the temples ).,mashup

Moreover they resolved to join all together and leave a memorial of themselves; and having so resolved they caused to be made a labyrinth  situated a little above the lake of Moiris and nearly opposite to that which is called the City of Crocodiles. This I saw myself  and I found it greater than words can say. For if one should put together and reckon up all the buildings and all the great works produced by the Hellenes  they would prove to be inferior in labour and expense to this labyrinth  though it is true that both the temple at Ephesos and that at Samos are works worthy of note. The pyramids also were greater than words can say  and each one of them is equal to many works of the Hellenes  great as they may be; but the labyrinth surpasses even the pyramids. It has twelve courts covered in  with gates facing one another  six upon the North side and six upon the South  joining on one to another  and the same wall surrounds them all outside; and there are in it two kinds of chambers  the one kind below the ground and the other above upon these  three thousand in number  of each kind fifteen hundred. The upper set of chambers we ourselves saw  going through them  and we tell of them having looked upon them with our own eyes; but the chambers under ground we heard about only; for the Egyptians who had charge of them were not willing on any account to show them  saying that here were the sepulchres of the kings who had first built this labyrinth and of the sacred crocodiles. Accordingly we speak of the chambers below by what we received from hearsay  while those above we saw ourselves and found them to be works of more than human greatness. For the passages through the chambers  and the goings this way and that way through the courts  which were admirably adorned  afforded endless matter for marvel  as we went through from a court to the chambers beyond it  and from the chambers to colonnades  and from the colonnades to other rooms  and then from the chambers again to other courts. Over the whole of these is a roof made of stone like the walls; and the walls are covered with figures carved upon them  each court being surrounded with pillars of white stone fitted together most perfectly; and at the end of the labyrinth  by the corner of it  there is a pyramid of forty fathoms  upon which large figures are carved  and to this there is a way made under ground.,mashup

Such is this labyrinth; but a cause for marvel even greater than this is afforded by the lake  which is called the lake of Moiris  along the side of which this labyrinth is built. The measure of its circuit is three thousand six hundred furlongs (being sixty  schoines  )  and this is the same number of furlongs as the extent of Egypt itself along the sea. The lake lies extended lengthwise from North to South  and in depth where it is deepest it is fifty fathoms. That this lake is artificial and formed by digging is self-evident  for about in the middle of the lake stand two pyramids  each rising above the water to a height of fifty fathoms  the part which is built below the water being of just the same height; and upon each is placed a colossal statue of stone sitting upon a chair. Thus the pyramids are a hundred fathoms high; and these hundred fathoms are equal to a furlong of six hundred feet  the fathom being measured as six feet or four cubits  the feet being four palms each  and the cubits six. The water in the lake does not come from the place where it is  for the country there is very deficient in water  but it has been brought thither from the Nile by a canal: and for six months the water flows into the lake  and for six months out into the Nile again; and whenever it flows out  then for the six months it brings into the royal treasury a talent of silver a day from the fish which are caught  and twenty pounds when the water comes in.,mashup

Now since I did not see anywhere existing the earth dug out of this excavation (for that was a matter which drew my attention )  I asked those who dwelt nearest to the lake where the earth was which had been dug out. These told me to what place it had been carried away; and I readily believed them  for I knew by report that a similar thing had been done at Nineveh  the city of the Assyrians. There certain thieves formed a design once to carry away the wealth of Sardanapallos son of Ninos  the king  which wealth was very great and was kept in treasure-houses under the earth. Accordingly they began from their own dwelling  and making estimate of their direction they dug under ground towards the king's palace; and the earth which was brought out of the excavation they used to carry away  when night came on  to the river Tigris which flows by the city of Nineveh  until at last they accomplished that which they desired. Similarly  as I heard  the digging of the lake in Egypt was effected  except that it was done not by night but during the day; for as they dug the Egyptians carried to the Nile the earth which was dug out; and the river  when it received it  would naturally bear it away and disperse it. Thus is this lake said to have been dug out.,mashup

Now the twelve kings continued to rule justly  but in course of time it happened thus:— After sacrifice in the temple of Hephaistos they were about to make libation on the last day of the feast  and the chief-priest  in bringing out for them the golden cups with which they had been wont to pour libations  missed his reckoning and brought eleven only for the twelve kings. Then that one of them who was standing last in order  namely Psammetichos  since he had no cup took off from his head his helmet  which was of bronze  and having held it out to receive the wine he proceeded to make libation: likewise all the other kings were wont to wear helmets and they happened to have them then. Now Psammetichos held out his helmet with no treacherous meaning; but they taking note of that which had been done by Psammetichos and of the oracle  namely how it had been declared to them that whosoever of them should make libation with a bronze cup should be sole king of Egypt  recollecting  I say  the saying of the Oracle  they did not indeed deem it right to slay Psammetichos  since they found by examination that he had not done it with any forethought  but they determined to strip him of almost all his power and to drive him away into the fen-country  and that from the fen- country he should not hold any dealings with the rest of Egypt.,mashup

This Psammetichos had formerly been a fugitive from the Ethiopian Sabacos who had killed his father Necos  from him  I say  he had then been a fugitive in Syria; and when the Ethiopian had departed in consequence of the vision of the dream  the Egyptians who were of the district of Sais brought him back to his own country. Then afterwards  when he was king  it was his fate to be a fugitive a second time on account of the helmet  being driven by the eleven kings into the fen- country. So then holding that he had been grievously wronged by them  he thought how he might take vengeance on those who had driven him out: and when he had sent to the Oracle of Leto in the city of Buto  where the Egyptians have their most truthful Oracle  there was given to him the reply that vengeance would come when men of bronze appeared from the sea. And he was strongly disposed not to believe that bronze men would come to help him; but after no long time had passed  certain Ionians and Carians who had sailed forth for plunder were compelled to come to shore in Egypt  and they having landed and being clad in bronze armour  one of the Egyptians  not having before seen men clad in bronze armour  came to the fen-land and brought a report to Psammetichos that bronze men had come from the sea and were plundering the plain. So he  perceiving that the saying of the Oracle was coming to pass  dealt in a friendly manner with the Ionians and Carians  and with large promises he persuaded them to take his part. Then when he had persuaded them  with the help of those Egyptians who favoured his cause and of these foreign mercenaries he overthrew the kings.,mashup

To the Ionians and to the Carians who had helped him Psammetichos granted portions of land to dwell in  opposite to one another with the river Nile between  and these were calledEncampments: these portions of land he gave them  and he paid them besides all that he had promised: moreover he placed with them Egyptian boys to have them taught the Hellenic tongue; and from these  who learnt the language thoroughly  are descended the present class of interpreters in Egypt. Now the Ionians and Carians occupied these portions of land for a long time  and they are towards the sea a little below the city of Bubastis  on that which is called the Pelusian mouth of the Nile. These men king Amasis afterwards removed from thence and established them at Memphis  making them into a guard for himself against the Egyptians: and they being settled in Egypt  we who are Hellenes know by intercourse with them the certainty of all that which happened in Egypt beginning from king Psammetichos and afterwards; for these were the first men of foreign tongue who settled in Egypt: and in the land from which they were removed there still remained down to my time the sheds where their ships were drawn up and the ruins of their houses. Thus then Psammetichos obtained Egypt:,mashup

This Oracle which is in Egypt is sacred to Leto  and it is established in a great city near that mouth of the Nile which is called Sebennytic  as one sails up the river from the sea; and the name of this city where the Oracle is found is Buto  as I have said before in mentioning it. In this Buto there is a temple of Apollo and Artemis; and the temple- house of Leto  in which the Oracle is  is both great in itself and has a gateway of the height of ten fathoms: but that which caused me most to marvel of the things to be seen there  I will now tell. There is in this sacred enclosure a house of Leto made of one single stone as regards both height and length  and of which all the walls are in these two directions equal  each being forty cubits; and for the covering in of the roof there lies another stone upon the top  the cornice measuring four cubits.,mashup

This is situated in a deep and broad lake by the side of the temple at Buto  and it is said by the Egyptians that this island is a floating island. I myself did not see it either floating about or moved from its place  and I feel surprise at hearing of it  wondering if it be indeed a floating island. In this island of which I speak there is a great temple-house of Apollo  and three several altars are set up within  and there are planted in the island many palm-trees and other trees  both bearing fruit and not bearing fruit. And the Egyptians  when they say that it is floating  add this story  namely that in this island  which formerly was not floating  Leto  being one of the eight gods who came into existence first  and dwelling in the city of Buto where she has this Oracle  received Apollo from Isis as a charge and preserved him  concealing him in the island which is said now to be a floating island  at that time when Typhon came after him seeking everywhere and desiring to find the son of Osiris. Now they say that Apollo and Artemis are children of Dionysos and of Isis  and that Leto became their nurse and preserver; and in the Egyptian tongue Apollo is Oros  Demeter is Isis  and Artemis is Bubastis. From this story and from no other �schylus the son of Euphorion took this which I shall say  wherein he differs from all the preceding poets; he represented namely that Artemis was the daughter of Demeter. For this reason then  they say  it became a floating island. Such is the story which they tell;,mashup

The son of Psammetichos was Necos  and he became king of Egypt. This man was the first who attempted the channel leading to the Erythraian Sea  which Dareios the Persian afterwards completed: the length of this is a voyage of four days  and in breadth it was so dug that two triremes could go side by side driven by oars; and the water is brought into it from the Nile. The channel is conducted a little above the city of Bubastis by Patumos the Arabian city  and runs into the Erythraian Sea: and it is dug first along those parts of the plain of Egypt which lie towards Arabia  just above which run the mountains which extend opposite Memphis  where are the stone-quarries — along the base of these mountains the channel is conducted from West to East for a great way; and after that it is directed towards a break in the hills and tends from these mountains towards the noon-day and the South Wind to the Arabian gulf. Now in the place where the journey is least and shortest from the Northern to the Southern Sea (which is also called Erythraian )  that is from Mount Casion  which is the boundary between Egypt and Syria  the distance is exactly a thousand furlongs to the Arabian gulf; but the channel is much longer  since it is more winding; and in the reign of Necos there perished while digging it twelve myriads of the Egyptians. Now Necos ceased in the midst of his digging  because the utterance of an Oracle impeded him  which was to the effect that he was working for the Barbarian: and the Egyptians call all men Barbarians who do not agree with them in speech.,mashup

These ships he used when he needed them; and also on land Necos engaged battle at Magdolos with the Syrians  and conquered them; and after this he took Cadytis  which is a great city of Syria: and the dress which he wore when he made these conquests he dedicated to Apollo  sending it to Branchidai of the Milesians.

While this Psammis was king of Egypt  there came to him men sent by the Eleians  who boasted that they ordered the contest at Olympia in the most just and honourable manner possible and thought that not even the Egyptians  the wisest of men  could find out anything besides  to be added to their rules. Now when the Eleians came to Egypt and said that for which they had come  then this king called together those of the Egyptians who were reputed the wisest  and when the Egyptians had come together they heard the Eleians tell of all that which it was their part to do in regard to the contest; and when they had related everything  they said that they had come to learn in addition anything which the Egyptians might be able to find out besides  which was juster than this. They then having consulted together asked the Eleians whether their own citizens took part in the contest; and they said that it was permitted to any one who desired it  both of their own people and of the other Hellenes equally  to take part in the contest: upon which the Egyptians said that in so ordering the games they had wholly missed the mark of justice; for it could not be but that they would take part with the man of their own State  if he was contending  and so act unfairly to the stranger: but if they really desired  as they said  to order the games justly  and if this was the cause for which they had come to Egypt  they advised them to order the contest so as to be for strangers alone to contend in  and that no Eleian should be permitted to contend.

When Psammis had been king of Egypt for only six years and had made an expedition to Ethiopia and immediately afterwards had ended his life  Apries the son of Psammis received the kingdom in succession. This man came to be the most prosperous of all the kings up to that time except only his forefather Psammetichos; and he reigned five-and-twenty years  during which he led an army against Sidon and fought a sea-fight with the king of Tyre. Since however it was fated that evil should come upon him  it came by occasion of a matter which I shall relate at greater length in the Libyan history  and at present but shortly. Apries having sent a great expedition against the Kyrenians  met with correspondingly great disaster; and the Egyptians considering him to blame for this revolted from him  supposing that Apries had with forethought sent them out to evident calamity  in order (as they said ) that there might be a slaughter of them  and he might the more securely rule over the other Egyptians. Being indignant at this  both these men who had returned from the expedition and also the friends of those who had perished made revolt openly.,mashup

Hearing this Apries sent to them Amasis  to cause them to cease by persuasion; and when he had come and was seeking to restrain the Egyptians  as he was speaking and telling them not to do so  one of the Egyptians stood up behind him and put a helmet upon his head  saying as he did so that he put it on to crown him king. And to him this that was done was in some degree not unwelcome  as he proved by his behaviour; for as soon as the revolted Egyptians had set him up as king  he prepared to march against Apries: and Apries hearing this sent to Amasis one of the Egyptians who were about his own person  a man of reputation  whose name was Patarbemis  enjoining him to bring Amasis alive into his presence. When this Patarbemis came and summoned Amasis  the latter  who happened to be sitting on horseback  lifted up his leg and behaved in an unseemly manner  bidding him take that back to Apries. Nevertheless  they say  Patarbemis made demand of him that he should go to the king  seeing that the king had sent to summon him; and he answered him that he had for some time past been preparing to do so  and that Apries would have no occasion to find fault with him. Then Patarbemis both perceiving his intention from that which he said  and also seeing his preparations  departed in haste  desiring to make known as quickly as possible to the king the things which were being done: and when he came back to Apries not bringing Amasis  the king paying no regard to that which he said  but being moved by violent anger  ordered his ears and his nose to be cut off. And the rest of the Egyptians who still remained on his side  when they saw the man of most repute among them thus suffering shameful outrage  waited no longer but joined the others in revolt  and delivered themselves over to Amasis.,mashup

Of these not one has learnt anything of handicraft  but they are given up to war entirely.,mashup

These are the districts of the Calasirians; and they reached  when most numerous  to the number of five-and-twenty myriads of men; nor is it lawful for these  any more than for the others  to practise any craft; but they practise that which has to do with war only  handing down the tradition from father to son.,mashup

The following privilege was specially granted to this class and to none others of the Egyptians except the priests  that is to say  each man had twelve yokes of land specially granted to him free from imposts: now the yoke of land measures a hundred Egyptian cubits every way  and the Egyptian cubit is  as it happens  equal to that of Samos. This  I say  was a special privilege granted to all  and they also had certain advantages in turn and not the same men twice; that is to say  a thousand of the Calasirians and a thousand of the Hermotybians acted as body-guard to the king during each year; and these had besides their yokes of land an allowance given them for each day of five pounds weight of bread to each man  and two pounds of beef  and four half-pints of wine. This was the allowance given to those who were serving as the king's bodyguard for the time being.,mashup

So when Apries leading his foreign mercenaries  and Amasis at the head of the whole body of the Egyptians  in their approach to one another had come to the city of Momemphis  they engaged battle: and although the foreign troops fought well  yet being much inferior in number they were worsted by reason of this. But Apries is said to have supposed that not even a god would be able to cause him to cease from his rule  so firmly did he think that it was established. In that battle then  I say  he was worsted  and being taken alive was brought away to the city of Sais  to that which had formerly been his own dwelling but from thenceforth was the palace of Amasis. There for some time he was kept in the palace  and Amasis dealt well with him; but at last  since the Egyptians blamed him  saying that he acted not rightly in keeping alive him who was the greatest foe both to themselves and to him  therefore he delivered Apries over to the Egyptians; and they strangled him  and after that buried him in the burial-place of his fathers: this is in the temple of Athene  close to the sanctuary  on the left hand as you enter. Now the men of Sais buried all those of this district who had been kings  within the temple; for the tomb of Amasis also  though it is further from the sanctuary than that of Apries and his forefathers  yet this too is within the court of the temple  and it consists of a colonnade of stone of great size  with pillars carved to imitate date-palms  and otherwise sumptuously adorned; and within the colonnade are double-doors  and inside the doors a sepulchral chamber.,mashup

The daughters of Danaos were they who brought this rite out of Egypt and taught it to the women of the Pelasgians; then afterwards when all the inhabitants of Peloponnese were driven out by the Dorians  the rite was lost  and only those who were left behind of the Peloponnesians and not driven out  that is to say the Arcadians  preserved it.,mashup

Apries having thus been overthrown  Amasis became king  being of the district of Sais  and the name of the city whence he was is Siuph. Now at the first the Egyptians despised Amasis and held him in no great regard  because he had been a man of the people and was of no distinguished family; but afterwards Amasis won them over to himself by wisdom and not wilfulness. Among innumerable other things of price which he had  there was a foot-basin of gold in which both Amasis himself and all his guests were wont always to wash their feet. This he broke up  and of it he caused to be made the image of a god  and set it up in the city  where it was most convenient; and the Egyptians went continually to visit the image and did great reverence to it. Then Amasis  having learnt that which was done by the men of the city  called together the Egyptians and made known to them the matter  saying that the image had been produced from the foot-basin  into which formerly the Egyptians used to vomit and make water  and in which they washed their feet  whereas now they did to it great reverence; and just so  he continued  had he himself now fared  as the foot-basin; for though formerly he was a man of the people  yet now he was their king  and he bade them accordingly honour him and have regard for him.,mashup

And his friends being troubled at it admonished him in some such words as these:O king  thou dost not rightly govern thyself in thus letting thyself descend to behaviour so trifling; for thou oughtest rather to have been sitting throughout the day stately upon a stately throne and administering thy business; and so the Egyptians would have been assured that they were ruled by a great man  and thou wouldest have had a better report: but as it is  thou art acting by no means in a kingly fashion. And he answered them thus:They who have bows stretch them at such time as they wish to use them  and when they have finished using them they loose them again; for if they were stretched tight always they would break  so that the men would not be able to use them when they needed them. So also is the state of man: if he should always be in earnest and not relax himself for sport at the due time  he would either go mad or be struck with stupor before he was aware; and knowing this well  I distribute a portion of the time to each of the two ways of living. Thus he replied to his friends.,mashup

It is said however that Amasis  even when he was in a private station  was a lover of drinking and of jesting  and not at all seriously disposed; and whenever his means of livelihood failed him through his drinking and luxurious living  he would go about and steal; and they from whom he stole would charge him with having their property  and when he denied it would bring him before the judgment of an Oracle  whenever there was one in their place; and many times he was convicted by the Oracles and many times he was absolved: and then when finally he became king he did as follows:— as many of the gods as had absolved him and pronounced him not to be a thief  to their temples he paid no regard  nor gave anything for the further adornment of them  nor even visited them to offer sacrifice  considering them to be worth nothing and to possess lying Oracles; but as many as had convicted him of being a thief  to these he paid very great regard  considering them to be truly gods  and to present Oracles which did not lie.,mashup

First in Sais he built and completed for Athene a temple-gateway which is a great marvel  and he far surpassed herein all who had done the like before  both in regard to height and greatness  so large are the stones and of such quality. Then secondly he dedicated great colossal statues and man-headed sphinxes very large  and for restoration he brought other stones of monstrous size. Some of these he caused to be brought from the stone-quarries which are opposite Memphis  others of very great size from the city of Elephantine  distant a voyage of not less than twenty days from Sais: and of them all I marvel most at this  namely a monolith chamber which he brought from the city of Elephantine; and they were three years engaged in bringing this  and two thousand men were appointed to convey it  who all were of the class of boatmen. Of this house the length outside is one-and-twenty cubits  the breadth is fourteen cubits  and the height eight. These are the measures of the monolith house outside; but the length inside is eighteen cubits and five- sixths of a cubit  the breadth twelve cubits  and the height five cubits. This lies by the side of the entrance to the temple; for within the temple they did not draw it  because  as it said  while the house was being drawn along  the chief artificer of it groaned aloud  seeing that much time had been spent and he was wearied by the work; and Amasis took it to heart as a warning and did not allow them to draw it further onwards. Some say on the other hand that a man was killed by it  of those who were heaving it with levers  and that it was not drawn in for that reason.,mashup

Amasis also dedicated in all the other temples which were of repute  works which are worth seeing for their size  and among them also at Memphis the colossal statue which lies on its back in front of the temple of Hephaistos  whose length is five-and-seventy feet; and on the same base made of the same stone are set two colossal statues  each of twenty feet in length  one on this side and the other on that side of the large statue. There is also another of stone of the same size in Sais  lying in the same manner as that at Memphis.

In the reign of Amasis it is said that Egypt became more prosperous than at any other time before  both in regard to that which comes to the land from the river and in regard to that which comes from the land to its inhabitants  and that at this time the inhabited towns in it numbered in all twenty thousand. It was Amasis too who established the law that every year each one of the Egyptians should declare to the ruler of his district  from what source he got his livelihood  and if any man did not do this or did not make declaration of an honest way of living  he should be punished with death. Now Solon the Athenian received from Egypt this law and had it enacted for the Athenians  and they have continued to observe it  since it is a law with which none can find fault.,mashup

Moreover Amasis became a lover of the Hellenes; and besides other proofs of friendship which he gave to several among them  he also granted the city of Naucratis for those of them who came to Egypt to dwell in; and to those who did not desire to stay  but who made voyages thither  he granted portions of land to set up altars and make sacred enclosures for their gods. Their greatest enclosure and that one which has most name and is most frequented is called the Hellenion  and this was established by the following cities in common:— of the Ionians Chios  Teos  Phocaia  Clazomenai  of the Dorians Rhodes  Cnidos  Halicarnassos  Phaselis  and of the Aiolians Mytilene alone. To these belongs this enclosure and these are the cities which appoint superintendents of the port; and all other cities which claim a share in it  are making a claim without any right. Besides this the Eginetans established on their own account a sacred enclosure dedicated to Zeus  the Samians one to Hera  and the Milesians one to Apollo.,mashup

Now whenever Amasis lay with her he found himself unable to have intercourse  but with his other wives he associated as he was wont; and as this happened repeatedly  Amasis said to his wife  whose name was Ladike:Woman  thou hast given me drugs  and thou shalt surely perish more miserably than any other woman. Then Ladike  when by her denials Amasis was not at all appeased in his anger against her  made a vow in her soul to Aphrodite  that if Amasis on that night had intercourse with her (seeing that this was the remedy for her danger )  she would send an image to be dedicated to her at Kyrene; and after the vow immediately Amasis had intercourse  and from thenceforth whenever Amasis came in to her he had intercourse with her; and after this he became very greatly attached to her. And Ladike paid the vow that she had made to the goddess; for she had an image made and sent it to Kyrene  and it was still preserved even to my own time  standing with its face turned away from the city of the Kyrenians. This Ladike Cambyses  having conquered Egypt and heard from her who she was  sent back unharmed to Kyrene.,mashup

Amasis also dedicated offerings in Hellas  first at Kyrene an image of Athene covered over with gold and a figure of himself made like by painting; then in the temple of Athene at Lindson two images of stone and a corslet of linen worthy to be seen; and also at Samos two wooden figures of himself dedicated to Hera  which were standing even to my own time in the great temple  behind the doors. Now at Samos he dedicated offerings because of the guest-friendship between himself and Polycrates the son of Aiakes; at Lindos for no guest- friendship but because the temple of Athene at Lindos is said to have been founded by the daughters of Danaos  who had touched land there at the time when they were fleeing from the sons of Aigyptos. These offerings were dedicated by Amasis; and he was the first of men who conquered Cyprus and subdued it so that it paid him tribute.,mashup

Against this Amasis then Cambyses the son of Cyrus was making his march  taking with him not only other nations of which he was ruler  but also Hellenes  both Ionians and Aiolians: and the cause of the expedition was as follows:— Cambyses sent an envoy to Egypt and asked Amasis to give him his daughter; and he made the request by counsel of an Egyptian  who brought this upon Amasis having a quarrel with him for the following reason:— at the time when Cyrus sent to Amasis and asked him for a physician of the eyes  whosoever was the best of those in Egypt  Amasis had selected him from all the physicians in Egypt and had torn him away from his wife and children and delivered him up to Persia. Having  I say  this cause of quarrel  the Egyptian urged Cambyses on by his counsel bidding him ask Amasis for his daughter  in order that he might either be grieved if he gave her  or if he refused to give her  might offend Cambyses. So Amasis  who was vexed by the power of the Persians and afraid of it  knew neither how to give nor how to refuse: for he was well assured that Cambyses did not intend to have her as his wife but as a concubine. So making account of the matter thus  he did as follows:— there was a daughter of Apries the former king  very tall and comely of form and the only person left of his house  and her name was Nitetis. This girl Amasis adorned with raiment and with gold  and sent her away to Persia as his own daughter: but after a time  when Cambyses saluted her calling her by the name of her father  the girl said to him:O king  thou dost not perceive how thou hast been deceived by Amasis; for he adorned me with ornaments and sent me away giving me to thee as his own daughter  whereas in truth I am the daughter of Apries against whom Amasis rose up with the Egyptians and murdered him  who was his lord and master. These words uttered and this occasion having arisen  led Cambyses the son of Cyrus against Egypt  moved to very great anger.,mashup

Such is the report made by the Persians; but as for the Egyptians they claim Cambyses as one of themselves  saying that he was born of this very daughter of Apries; for they say that Cyrus was he who sent to Amasis for his daughter  and not Cambyses. In saying this however they say not rightly; nor can they have failed to observe (for the Egyptians fully as well as any other people are acquainted with the laws and customs of the Persians )  first that it is not customary among them for a bastard to become king  when there is a son born of a true marriage  and secondly that Cambyses was the son of Cassandane the daughter of Pharnaspes  a man of the Achaimenid family  and not the son of the Egyptian woman: but they pervert the truth of history  claiming to be kindred with the house of Cyrus.

Thus she spoke  they say  being vexed by Nitetis  and upon that Cambyses the elder of her sons said:For this cause  mother  when I am grown to be a man  I will make that which is above in Egypt to be below  and that which is below above. This he is reported to have said when he was perhaps about ten years old  and the women were astonished by it: and he  they say  kept it ever in mind  and so at last when he had become a man and had obtained the royal power  he made the expedition against Egypt.,mashup

Another thing also contributed to this expedition  which was as follows:— There was among the foreign mercenaries of Amasis a man who was by race of Halicarnassos  and his name was Phanes  one who was both capable in judgment and valiant in that which pertained to war. This Phanes  having (as we may suppose ) some quarrel with Amasis  fled away from Egypt in a ship  desiring to come to speech with Cambyses: and as he was of no small repute among the mercenaries and was very closely acquainted with all the affairs of Egypt  Amasis pursued him and considered it a matter of some moment to capture him: and he pursued by sending after him the most trusted of his eunuchs with a trireme  who captured him in Lykia; but having captured him he did not bring him back to Egypt  since Phanes got the better of him by cunning; for he made his guards drunk and escaped to Persia. So when Cambyses had made his resolve to march upon Egypt  and was in difficulty about the march  as to how he should get safely through the waterless region  this man came to him and besides informing of the other matters of Amasis  he instructed him also as to the march  advising him to send to the king of the Arabians and ask that he would give him safety of passage through this region.,mashup

Now by this way only is there a known entrance to Egypt: for from Phenicia to the borders of the city of Cadytis belongs to the Syrians who are called of Palestine  and from Cadytis  which is a city I suppose not much less than Sardis  from this city the trading stations on the sea- coast as far as the city of Ienysos belong to the king of Arabia  and then from Ienysos again the country belongs to the Syrians as far as the Serbonian lake  along the side of which Mount Casion extends towards the Sea. After that  from the Serbonian lake  in which the story goes that Typhon is concealed  from this point onwards the land is Egypt. Now the region which lies between the city of Ienysos on the one hand and Mount Casion and the Serbonian lake on the other  which is of no small extent but as much as a three days' journey  is grievously destitute of water.,mashup

And one thing I shall tell of  which few of those who go in ships to Egypt have observed  and it is this:— into Egypt from all parts of Hellas and also from Phenicia are brought twice every year earthenware jars full of wine  and yet it may almost be said that you cannot see there one single empty wine-jar. In what manner  then  it will be asked  are they used up? This also I will tell. The head-man of each place must collect all the earthenware jars from his own town and convey them to Memphis  and those at Memphis must fill them with water and convey them to these same waterless regions of Syria: this the jars which come regularly to Egypt and are emptied there  are carried to Syria to be added to that which has come before.,mashup

It was the Persians who thus prepared this approach to Egypt  furnishing it with water in the manner which has been said  from the time when they first took possession of Egypt: but at the time of which I speak  seeing that water was not yet provided  Cambyses  in accordance with what he was told by his Halicarnassian guest  sent envoys to the Arabian king and from him asked and obtained the safe passage  having given him pledges of friendship and received them from him in return.,mashup

When the man has completed these ceremonies  he who has given the pledges commends to the care of his friends the stranger (or the fellow-tribesman  if he is giving the pledges to one who is a member of his tribe )  and the friends think it right that they also should have regard for the pledges given. Of gods they believe in Dionysos and Urania alone: moreover they say that the cutting of their hair is done after the same fashion as that of Dionysos himself; and they cut their hair in a circle round  shaving away the hair of the temples. Now they call Dionysos Orotalt and Urania they call Alilat.,mashup

So then when the Arabian king had given the pledge of friendship to the men who had come to him from Cambyses  he contrived as follows:— he took skins of camels and filled them with water and loaded them upon the backs of all the living camels that he had; and having so done he drove them to the waterless region and there awaited the army of Cambyses. This which has been related is the more credible of the accounts given  but the less credible must also be related  since it is a current account. There is a great river in Arabia called Corys  and this runs out into the Sea which is called Erythraian. From this river then it is said that the king of the Arabians  having got a conduit pipe made by sewing together raw ox-hides and other skins  of such a length as to reach to the waterless region  conducted the water through these forsooth  and had great cisterns dug in the waterless region  that they might receive the water and preserve it. Now it is a journey of twelve days from the river to this waterless region; and moreover the story says that he conducted the water by three conduit-pipes to three different parts of it.,mashup

Meanwhile Psammenitos the son of Amasis was encamped at the Pelusian mouth of the Nile waiting for the coming of Cambyses: for Cambyses did not find Amasis yet living when he marched upon Egypt  but Amasis had died after having reigned forty and four years during which no great misfortune had befallen him: and when he had died and had been embalmed he was buried in the burial-place in the temple  which he had built for himself. Now when Psammenitos son of Amasis was reigning as king  there happened to the Egyptians a prodigy  the greatest that had ever happened: for rain fell at Thebes in Egypt  where never before had rain fallen nor afterwards down to my time  as the Thebans themselves say; for in the upper parts of Egypt no rain falls at all: but at the time of which I speak rain fell at Thebes in a drizzling shower.,mashup

Now when the Persians had marched quite through the waterless region and were encamped near the Egyptians with design to engage battle  then the foreign mercenaries of the Egyptian king  who were Hellenes and Carians  having a quarrel with Phanes because he had brought against Egypt an army of foreign speech  contrived against him as follows:— Phanes had children whom he had left behind in Egypt: these they brought to their camp and into the sight of their father  and they set up a mixing-bowl between the two camps  and after that they brought up the children one by one and cut their throats so that the blood ran into the bowl. Then when they had gone through the whole number of the children  they brought and poured into the bowl both wine and water  and not until the mercenaries had all drunk of the blood  did they engage battle. Then after a battle had been fought with great stubbornness  and very many had fallen of both the armies  the Egyptians at length turned to flight.,mashup

I was witness moreover of a great marvel  being informed of it by the natives of the place; for of the bones scattered about of those who fell in this fight  each side separately  since the bones of the Persians were lying apart on one side according as they were divided at first  and those of the Egyptians on the other  the skulls of the Persians are so weak that if you shall hit them only with a pebble you will make a hole in them  while those of the Egyptians are so exceedingly strong that you would hardly break them if you struck them with a large stone. The cause of it  they say  was this  and I for my part readily believe them  namely that the Egyptians beginning from their early childhood shave their heads  and the bone is thickened by exposure to the sun: and this is also the cause of their not becoming bald-headed; for among the Egyptians you see fewer bald-headed men than among any other race. This then is the reason why these have their skulls strong; and the reason why the Persians have theirs weak is that they keep them delicately in the shade from the first by wearing  tiaras  that is felt caps. So far of this: and I saw also a similar thing to this at Papremis  in the case of those who were slain together with Achaimenes the son of Dareios  by Inaros the Libyan.,mashup

The Egyptians when they turned to flight from the battle fled in disorder: and they being shut up in Memphis  Cambyses sent a ship of Mytilene up the river bearing a Persian herald  to summon the Egyptians to make terms of surrender; but they  when they saw the ship had entered into Memphis  pouring forth in a body from the fortress both destroyed the ship and also tore the men in it limb from limb  and so bore them into the fortress. After this the Egyptians being besieged  in course of time surrendered themselves; and the Libyans who dwell on the borders of Egypt  being struck with terror by that which had happened to Egypt  delivered themselves up without resistance  and they both laid on themselves a tribute and sent presents: likewise also those of Kyrene and Barca  being struck with terror equally with the Libyans  acted in a similar manner: and Cambyses accepted graciously the gifts which came from the Libyans  but as for those which came from the men of Kyrene  finding fault with them  as I suppose  because they were too small in amount (for the Kyrenians sent in fact five hundred pounds' weight of silver )  he took the silver by handfuls and scattered it with his own hand among his soldiers.,mashup

On the tenth day after that on which he received the surrender of the fortress of Memphis  Cambyses set the king of the Egyptians Psammenitos  who had been king for six months  to sit in the suburb of the city  to do him dishonour — him I say with other Egyptians he set there  and he proceeded to make trial of his spirit as follows:— having arrayed his daughter in the clothing of a slave  he sent her forth with a pitcher to fetch water  and with her he sent also other maidens chosen from the daughters of the chief men  arrayed as was the daughter of the king: and as the maidens were passing by their fathers with cries and lamentation  the other men all began to cry out and lament aloud  seeing that their children had been evilly entreated  but Psammenitos when he saw it before his eyes and perceived it bent himself down to the earth. Then when the water- bearers had passed by  next Cambyses sent his son with two thousand Egyptians besides who were of the same age  with ropes bound round their necks and bits placed in their mouths; and these were being led away to execution to avenge the death of the Mytilenians who had been destroyed at Memphis with their ship: for the Royal Judges had decided that for each man ten of the noblest Egyptians should lose their lives in retaliation. He then  when he saw them passing out by him and perceived that his son was leading the way to die  did the same as he had done with respect to his daughter  while the other Egyptians who sat round him were lamenting and showing signs of grief. When these also had passed by  it chanced that a man of his table companions  advanced in years  who had been deprived of all his possessions and had nothing except such things as a beggar possesses  and was asking alms from the soldiers  passed by Psammenitos the son of Amasis and the Egyptians who were sitting in the suburb of the city: and when Psammenitos saw him he uttered a great cry of lamentation  and he called his companion by name and beat himself upon the head. Now there was  it seems  men set to watch him  who made known to Cambyses all that he did on the occasion of each going forth: and Cambyses marvelled at that which he did  and he sent a messenger and asked him thus:Psammenitos  thy master Cambyses asks thee for what reason  when thou sawest thy daughter evilly entreated and thy son going to death  thou didst not cry aloud nor lament for them  whereas thou didst honour with these signs of grief the beggar who  as he hears from others  is not in any way related to thee ? Thus he asked  and the other answered as follows:O son of Cyrus  my own troubles were too great for me to lament them aloud  but the trouble of my companion was such as called for tears  seeing that he has been deprived of great wealth  and has come to beggary upon the threshold of old age. When this saying was reported by the messenger  it seemed to them that it was well spoken; and  as is reported by the Egyptians  Croesus shed tears (for he also  as fortune would have it  had accompanied Cambyses to Egypt ) and the Persians who were present shed tears also; and there entered some pity into Cambyses himself  and forthwith he bade them save the life of the son of Psammenitos from among those who were being put to death  and also he bade them raise Psammenitos himself from his place in the suburb of the city and bring him into his own presence.,mashup

Of this  namely that it is their established rule to act so  one may judge by many instances besides and especially by the case of Thannyras the son of Inaros  who received back the power which his father had  and by that of Pausiris the son of Amyrtaios  for he too received back the power of his father: yet it is certain that no men ever up to this time did more evil to the Persians than Inaros and Amyrtaios. As it was  however  Psammenitos devised evil and received the due reward: for he was found to be inciting the Egyptians to revolt; and when this became known to Cambyses  Psammenitos drank bull's blood and died forthwith.

From Memphis Cambyses came to the city of Sais with the purpose of doing that which in fact he did: for when he had entered into the palace of Amasis  he forthwith gave command to bring the corpse of Amasis forth out of his burial-place; and when this had been accomplished  he gave command to scourge it and pluck out the hair and stab it  and to do to it dishonour in every possible way besides: and when they had done this too until they were wearied out  for the corpse being embalmed held out against the violence and did not fall to pieces in any part  Cambyses gave command to consume it with fire  enjoining thereby a thing which was not permitted by religion: for the Persians hold fire to be a god. To consume corpses with fire then is by no means according to the custom of either people  of the Persians for the reason which has been mentioned  since they say that it is not right to give the dead body of a man to a god; while the Egyptians have the belief established that fire is a living wild beast  and that it devours everything which it catches  and when it is satiated with the food it dies itself together with that which it devours: but it is by no means their custom to give the corpse of a man to wild beasts  for which reason they embalm it  that it may not be eaten by worms as it lies in the tomb. Thus then Cambyses was enjoining them to do that which is not permitted by the customs of either people. However  the Egyptians say that it was not Amasis who suffered this outrage  but another of the Egyptians who was of the same stature of body as Amasis; and that to him the Persians did outrage  thinking that they were doing it to Amasis: for they say that Amasis learnt from an Oracle that which was about to happen with regard to himself after his death; and accordingly  to avert the evil which threatened to come upon him  he buried the dead body of this man who was scourged within his own sepulchral chamber near the doors  and enjoined his son to lay his own body as much as possible in the inner recess of the chamber. These injunctions  said to have been given by Amasis with regard to his burial and with regard to the man mentioned  were not in my opinion really given at all  but I think that the Egyptians make pretence of it from pride and with no good ground.,mashup

After this Cambyses planned three several expeditions  one against the Carthaginians  another against the Ammonians  and a third against theLong-lived Ethiopians  who dwell in that part of Libya which is by the Southern Sea: and in forming these designs he resolved to send his naval force against the Carthaginians  and a body chosen from his land-army against the Ammonians; and to the Ethiopians to send spies first  both to see whether the table of the Sun existed really  which is said to exist among these Ethiopians  and in addition to this to spy out all else  but pretending to be bearers of gifts for their king.,mashup

So when Cambyses had resolved to send the spies  forthwith he sent for those men of the Ichthyophagoi who understood the Ethiopian tongue  to come from the city of Elephantine: and while they were going to fetch these men  he gave command to the fleet to sail against Carthage: but the Phenicians said that they would not do so  for they were bound not to do so by solemn vows  and they would not be acting piously if they made expedition against their own sons: and as the Phenicians were not willing  the rest were rendered unequal to the attempt. Thus then the Carthaginians escaped being enslaved by the Persians; for Cambyses did not think it right to apply force to compel the Phenicians  both because they had delivered themselves over to the Persians of their own accord and because the whole naval force was dependent upon the Phenicians. Now the men of Cyprus also had delivered themselves over to the Persians  and were joining in the expedition against Egypt.,mashup

Now these Ethiopians to whom Cambyses was sending are said to be the tallest and the most beautiful of all men; and besides other customs which they are reported to have different from other men  there is especially this  it is said  with regard to their regal power — whomsoever of the men of their nation they judge to be the tallest and to have strength in proportion to his stature  this man they appoint to reign over them.,mashup

So when the Ichthyophagoi had come to this people they presented their gifts to the king who ruled over them  and at the same time they said as follows:The king of the Persians Cambyses  desiring to become a friend and guest to thee  sent us with command to come to speech with thee  and he gives thee for gifts these things which he himself most delights to use. The Ethiopian however  perceiving that they had come as spies  spoke to them as follows:Neither did the king of the Persians send you bearing gifts because he thought it a matter of great moment to become my guest-friend  nor do ye speak true things (for ye have come as spies of my kingdom )  nor again is he a righteous man; for if he had been righteous he would not have coveted a land other than his own  nor would he be leading away into slavery men at whose hands he has received no wrong. Now however give him this bow and speak to him these words: The king of the Ethiopians gives this counsel to the king of the Persians  that when the Persians draw their bows (of equal size to mine ) as easily as I do this  then he should march against the Long-lived Ethiopians  provided that he be superior in numbers; but until that time he should feel gratitude to the gods that they do not put it into the mind of the sons of the Ethiopians to acquire another land in addition to their own.,mashup

Having thus said and having unbent the bow  he delivered it to those who had come. Then he took the garment of purple and asked what it was and how it had been made: and when the Ichthyophagoi had told him the truth about the purple-fish and the dyeing of the tissue  he said that the men were deceitful and deceitful also were their garments. Then secondly he asked concerning the twisted gold of the collar and the bracelets; and when the Ichthyophagoi were setting forth to him the manner in which it was fashioned  the king broke into a laugh and said  supposing them to be fetters  that they had stronger fetters than those in their country. Thirdly he asked about the perfumed ointment  and when they had told him of the manner of its making and of the anointing with it  he said the same as he had said before about the garment. Then when he came to the wine  and had learned about the manner of its making  being exceedingly delighted with the taste of the drink he asked besides what food the king ate  and what was the longest time that a Persian man lived. They told him that he ate bread  explaining to him first the manner of growing the wheat  and they said that eighty years was the longest term of life appointed for a Persian man. In answer to this the Ethiopian said that he did not wonder that they lived but a few years  when they fed upon dung; for indeed they would not be able to live even so many years as this  if they did not renew their vigour with the drink  indicating to the Ichthyophagoi the wine; for in regard to this  he said  his people were much behind the Persians.,mashup

Then when the Ichthyophagoi asked the king in return about the length of days and the manner of life of his people  he answered that the greater number of them reached the age of a hundred and twenty years  and some surpassed even this; and their food was boiled flesh and their drink was milk. And when the spies marvelled at the number of years  he conducted them to a certain spring  in the water of which they washed and became more sleek of skin  as if it were a spring of oil; and from it there came a scent as it were of violets: and the water of this spring  said the spies  was so exceedingly weak that it was not possible for anything to float upon it  either wood or any of those things which are lighter than wood  but they all went to the bottom. If this water which they have be really such as it is said to be  it would doubtless be the cause why the people are long-lived  as making use of it for all the purposes of life. Then when they departed from this spring  he led them to a prison-house for men  and there all were bound in fetters of gold. Now among these Ethiopians bronze is the rarest and most precious of all things. Then when they had seen the prison-house they saw also the so-called table of the Sun:,mashup

After they had seen all  the spies departed to go back; and when they reported these things  forthwith Cambyses was enraged and proceeded to march his army against the Ethiopians  not having ordered any provision of food nor considered with himself that he was intending to march an army to the furthest extremities of the earth; but as one who is mad and not in his right senses  when he heard the report of the Ichthyophagoi he began the march  ordering those of the Hellenes who were present to remain behind in Egypt  and taking with him his whole land force: and when in the course of his march he had arrived at Thebes  he divided off about fifty thousand of his army  and these he enjoined to make slaves of the Ammonians and to set fire to the seat of the Oracle of Zeus  but he himself with the remainder of his army went on against the Ethiopians. But before the army had passed over the fifth part of the way  all that they had of provisions came to an end completely; and then after the provisions the beasts of burden also were eaten up and came to an end. Now if Cambyses when he perceived this had changed his plan and led his army back  he would have been a wise man in spite of his first mistake; as it was  however  he paid no regard  but went on forward without stopping. The soldiers accordingly  so long as they were able to get anything from the ground  prolonged their lives by eating grass; but when they came to the sand  some did a fearful deed  that is to say  out of each company of ten they selected by lot one of themselves and devoured him: and Cambyses  when he heard it  being alarmed by this eating of one another gave up the expedition against the Ethiopians and set forth to go back again; and he arrived at Thebes having suffered loss of a great number of his army. Then from Thebes he came down to Memphis and allowed the Hellenes to sail away home.,mashup

Thus fared the expedition against the Ethiopians: and those of the Persians who had been sent to march against the Ammonians set forth from Thebes and went on their way with guides; and it is known that they arrived at the city of Oasis  which is inhabited by Samians said to be of the Aischrionian tribe  and is distant seven days' journey from Thebes over sandy desert: now this place is called in the speech of the Hellenes theIsle of the Blessed. It is said that the army reached this place  but from that point onwards  except the Ammonians themselves and those who have heard the account from them  no man is able to say anything about them; for they neither reached the Ammonians nor returned back. This however is added to the story by the Ammonians themselves:— they say that as the army was going from this Oasis through the sandy desert to attack them  and had got to a point about mid-way between them and the Oasis  while they were taking their morning meal a violent South Wind blew upon them  and bearing with it heaps of the desert sand it buried them under it  and so they disappeared and were seen no more. Thus the Ammonians say that it came to pass with regard to this army.,mashup

When Cambyses arrived at Memphis  Apis appeared to the Egyptians  whom the Hellenes call Epaphos: and when he had appeared  forthwith the Egyptians began to wear their fairest garments and to have festivities. Cambyses accordingly seeing the Egyptians doing thus  and supposing that they were certainly acting so by way of rejoicing because he had fared ill  called for the officers who had charge of Memphis; and when they had come into his presence  he asked them why when he was at Memphis on the former occasion  the Egyptians were doing nothing of this kind  but only now  when he came there after losing a large part of his army. They said that a god had appeared to them  who was wont to appear at intervals of long time  and that whenever he appeared  then all the Egyptians rejoiced and kept festival. Hearing this Cambyses said that they were lying  and as liars he condemned them to death.,mashup

Having put these to death  next he called the priests into his presence; and when the priests answered him after the same manner  he said that it should not be without his knowledge if a tame god had come to the Egyptians; and having so said he bade the priests bring Apis away into his presence: so they went to bring him. Now this Apis-Epaphos is a calf born of a cow who after this is not permitted to conceive any other offspring; and the Egyptians say that a flash of light comes down from heaven upon this cow  and of this she produces Apis. This calf which is called Apis is black and has the following signs  namely a white square upon the forehead  and on the back the likeness of an eagle  and in the tail the hairs are double  and on the tongue there is a mark like a beetle.,mashup

Worthy indeed of Egyptians is such a god as this. Ye however at least shall not escape without punishment for making a mock of me. Having thus spoken he ordered those whose duty it was to do such things  to scourge the priests without mercy  and to put to death any one of the other Egyptians whom they should find keeping the festival. Thus the festival of the Egyptians had been brought to an end  and the priests were being chastised  and Apis wounded by the stroke in his thigh lay dying in the temple.,mashup

Him  when he had brought his life to an end by reason of the wound  the priests buried without the knowledge of Cambyses: but Cambyses  as the Egyptians say  immediately after this evil deed became absolutely mad  not having been really in his right senses even before that time: and the first of his evil deeds was that he put to death his brother Smerdis  who was of the same father and the same mother as himself. This brother he had sent away from Egypt to Persia in envy  because alone of all the Persians he had been able to draw the bow which the Ichthyophagoi brought from the Ethiopian king  to an extent of about two finger-breadths; while of the other Persians not one had proved able to do this. Then when Smerdis had gone away to Persia  Cambyses saw a vision in his sleep of this kind:— it seemed to him that a messenger came from Persia and reported that Smerdis sitting upon the royal throne had touched the heaven with his head. Fearing therefore with regard to this lest his brother might slay him and reign in his stead  he sent Prexaspes to Persia  the man whom of all the Persians he trusted most  with command to slay him. He accordingly went up to Susa and slew Smerdis; and some say that he took him out of the chase and so slew him  others that he brought him to the Erythraian Sea and drowned him.,mashup

This they say was the first beginning of the evil deeds of Cambyses; and next after this he put to death his sister  who had accompanied him to Egypt  to whom also he was married  she being his sister by both parents. Now he took her to wife in the following manner (for before this the Persians had not been wont at all to marry their sisters ):— Cambyses fell in love with one of his sisters  and desired to take her to wife; so since he had it in mind to do that which was not customary  he called the Royal Judges and asked them whether there existed any law which permitted him who desired it to marry his sister. Now the Royal Judges are men chosen out from among the Persians  and hold their office until they die or until some injustice is found in them  so long and no longer. These pronounce decisions for the Persians and are the expounders of the ordinances of their fathers  and all matters are referred to them. So when Cambyses asked them  they gave him an answer which was both upright and safe  saying that they found no law which permitted a brother to marry his sister  but apart from that they had found a law to the effect that the king of the Persians might do whatsoever he desired. Thus on the one hand they did not tamper with the law for fear of Cambyses  and at the same time  that they might not perish themselves in maintaining the law  they found another law beside that which was asked for  which was in favour of him who wished to marry his sisters. So Cambyses at that time took to wife her with whom he was in love  but after no long time he took another sister. Of these it was the younger whom he put to death  she having accompanied him to Egypt.,mashup

About her death  as about the death of Smerdis  two different stories are told. The Hellenes say that Cambyses had matched a lion's cub in fight with a dog's whelp  and this wife of his was also a spectator of it; and when the whelp was being overcome  another whelp  its brother  broke its chain and came to help it; and having become two instead of one  the whelps then got the better of the cub: and Cambyses was pleased at the sight  but she sitting by him began to weep; and Cambyses perceived it and asked wherefore she wept; and she said that she had wept when she saw that the whelp had come to the assistance of its brother  because she remembered Smerdis and perceived that there was no one who would come to his assistance. The Hellenes say that it was for this saying that she was killed by Cambyses: but the Egyptians say that as they were sitting round at table  the wife took a lettuce and pulled off the leaves all round  and then asked her husband whether the lettuce was fairer when thus plucked round or when covered with leaves  and he saidwhen covered with leaves: she then spoke thus:Nevertheless thou didst once produce the likeness of this lettuce  when thou didst strip bare the house of Cyrus. And he moved to anger leapt upon her  being with child  and she miscarried and died.,mashup

The following also are acts of madness which he did to the other Persians:— To Prexaspes  the man whom he honoured most and who used to bear his messages (his son also was cup-bearer to Cambyses  and this too was no small honour ) — to him it is said that he spoke as follows:Prexaspes  what kind of a man do the Persians esteem me to be  and what speech do they hold concerning me ? and he said:Master  in all other respects thou art greatly commended  but they say that thou art overmuch given to love of wine. Thus he spoke concerning the Persians; and upon that Cambyses was roused to anger  and answered thus:It appears then that the Persians say I am given to wine  and that therefore I am beside myself and not in my right mind; and their former speech then was not sincere. For before this time  it seems  when the Persians and Croesus were sitting with him in council  Cambyses asked what kind of a man they thought he was as compared with his father Cyrus; and they answered that he was better than his father  for he not only possessed all that his father had possessed  but also in addition to this had acquired Egypt and the Sea. Thus the Persians spoke; but Croesus  who was present and was not satisfied with their judgment  spoke thus to Cambyses:To me  O son of Cyrus  thou dost not appear to be equal to thy father  for not yet hast thou a son such as he left behind him in you. Hearing this Cambyses was pleased  and commended the judgment of Croesus.,mashup

So calling to mind this  he said in anger to Prexaspes:Learn then now for thyself whether the Persians speak truly  or whether when they say this they are themselves out of their senses: for if I  shooting at thy son there standing before the entrance of the chamber  hit him in the very middle of the heart  the Persians will be proved to be speaking falsely  but if I miss  then thou mayest say that the Persians are speaking the truth and that I am not in my right mind. Having thus said he drew his bow and hit the boy; and when the boy had fallen down  it is said that he ordered them to cut open his body and examine the place where he was hit; and as the arrow was found to be sticking in the heart  he laughed and was delighted  and said to the father of the boy:Prexaspes  it has now been made evident  as thou seest  that I am not mad  but that it is the Persians who are out of their senses; and now tell me  whom of all men didst thou ever see before this time hit the mark so well in shooting ? Then Prexaspes  seeing that the man was not in his right senses and fearing for himself  said:Master  I think that not even God himself could have hit the mark so fairly. Thus he did at that time: and at another time he condemned twelve of the Persians  men equal to the best  on a charge of no moment  and buried them alive with the head downwards.,mashup

Thou however are putting to death men who are of thine own people  condemning them on charges of no moment  and thou art putting to death men's sons also. If thou do many such things  beware lest the Persians make revolt from thee. As for me  thy father Cyrus gave me charge  earnestly bidding me to admonish thee  and suggest to thee that which I should find to be good. Thus he counselled him  manifesting goodwill towards him; but Cambyses answered:Dost  thou  venture to counsel me  who excellently well didst rule thine own country  and well didst counsel my father  bidding him pass over the river Araxes and go against the Massagetai  when they were willing to pass over into our land  and so didst utterly ruin thyself by ill government of thine own land  and didst utterly ruin Cyrus  who followed thy counsel. However thou shalt not escape punishment now  for know that before this I had very long been desiring to find some occasion against thee. Thus having said he took his bow meaning to shoot him  but Croesus started up and ran out: and so since he could not shoot him  he gave orders to his attendants to take and slay him. The attendants however  knowing his moods  concealed Croesus  with the intention that if Cambyses should change his mind and seek to have Croesus again  they might produce him and receive gifts as the price of saving his life; but if he did not change his mind nor feel desire to have him back  then they might kill him. Not long afterwards Cambyses did in fact desire to have Croesus again  and the attendants perceiving this reported to him that he was still alive: and Cambyses said that he rejoiced with Croesus that he was still alive  but that they who had preserved him should not get off free  but he would put them to death: and thus he did.,mashup

Many such acts of madness did he both to Persians and allies  remaining at Memphis and opening ancient tombs and examining the dead bodies. Likewise also he entered into the temple of Hephaistos and very much derided the image of the god: for the image of Hephaistos very nearly resembles the Phenician  Pataicoi  which the Phenicians carry about on the prows of their triremes; and for him who has not seen these  I will indicate its nature — it is the likeness of a dwarfish man. He entered also into the temple of the Cabeiroi  into which it is not lawful for any one to enter except the priest only  and the images there he even set on fire  after much mockery of them. Now these also are like the images of Hephaistos  and it is said that they are the children of that god.,mashup

It is clear to me therefore by every kind of proof that Cambyses was mad exceedingly; for otherwise he would not have attempted to deride religious rites and customary observances. For if one should propose to all men a choice  bidding them select the best customs from all the customs that there are  each race of men  after examining them all  would select those of his own people; thus all think that their own customs are by far the best: and so it is not likely that any but a madman would make a jest of such things. Now of the fact that all men are thus wont to think about their customs  we may judge by many other proofs and more specially by this which follows:— Dareios in the course of his reign summoned those of the Hellenes who were present in his land  and asked them for what price they would consent to eat up their fathers when they died; and they answered that for no price would they do so. After this Dareios summoned those Indians who are called Callatians  who eat their parents  and asked them in presence of the Hellenes  who understood what they said by help of an interpreter  for what payment they would consent to consume with fire the bodies of their fathers when they died; and they cried out aloud and bade him keep silence from such words. Thus then these things are established by usage  and I think that Pindar spoke rightly in his verse  when he said thatof all things law is king.,mashup

Now while Cambyses was marching upon Egypt  the Lacedemonians also had made an expedition against Samos and against Polycrates the son of Aiakes  who had risen against the government and obtained rule over Samos. At first he had divided the State into three parts and had given a share to his brothers Pantagnotos and Syloson; but afterwards he put to death one of these  and the younger  namely Syloson  he drove out  and so obtained possession of the whole of Samos. Then  being in possession  he made a guest-friendship with Amasis the king of Egypt  sending him gifts and receiving gifts in return from him. After this straightway within a short period of time the power of Polycrates increased rapidly  and there was much fame of it not only in Ionia  but also over the rest of Hellas: for to whatever part he directed his forces  everything went fortunately for him: and he had got for himself a hundred fifty-oared galleys and a thousand archers  and he plundered from all  making no distinction of any; for it was his wont to say that he would win more gratitude from his friend by giving back to him that which he had taken  than by not taking at all. So he had conquered many of the islands and also many cities of the continent  and besides other things he gained the victory in a sea-fight over the Lesbians  as they were coming to help the Milesians with their forces  and conquered them: these men dug the whole trench round the wall of the city of Samos working in chains.,mashup

Now Amasis  as may be supposed  did not fail to perceive that Polycrates was very greatly fortunate  and it was to him an object of concern; and as much more good fortune yet continued to come to Polycrates  he wrote upon a paper these words and sent them to Samos:Amasis to Polycrates thus saith:— It is a pleasant thing indeed to hear that one who is a friend and guest is faring well; yet to me thy great good fortune is not pleasing  since I know that the Divinity is jealous; and I think that I desire  both for myself and for those about whom I have care  that in some of our affairs we should be prosperous and in others should fail  and thus go through life alternately faring well and ill  rather than that we should be prosperous in all things: for never yet did I hear tell of any one who was prosperous in all things and did not come to an utterly evil end at the last. Now therefore do thou follow my counsel and act as I shall say with respect to thy prosperous fortunes. Take thought and consider  and that which thou findest to be the most valued by thee  and for the loss of which thou wilt most be vexed in thy soul  that take and cast away in such a manner that it shall never again come to the sight of men; and if in future from that time forward good fortune does not befall thee in alternation with calamities  apply remedies in the manner by me suggested.,mashup

Τοῦτο δὲ ποιήσας ἀπέπλεε  ἀπικόμενος δὲ ἐς τὰ οἰκία συμφορῇ ἐχρᾶτο. Polycrates  having read this and having perceived by reflection that Amasis suggested to him good counsel  sought to find which one of his treasures he would be most afflicted in his soul to lose; and seeking he found this which I shall say:— he had a signet which he used to wear  enchased in gold and made of an emerald stone; and it was the work of Theodoros the son of Telecles of Samos. Seeing then that he thought it good to cast this away  he did thus:— he manned a fifty-oared galley with sailors and went on board of it himself; and then he bade them put out into the deep sea. And when he had got to a distance from the island  he took off the signet-ring  and in the sight of all who were with him in the ship he threw it into the sea. Thus having done he sailed home; and when he came to his house he mourned for his loss.,mashup

But on the fifth or sixth day after these things it happened to him as follows:— a fisherman having caught a large and beautiful fish  thought it right that this should be given as a gift to Polycrates. He bore it therefore to the door of the palace and said that he desired to come into the presence of Polycrates  and when he had obtained this he gave him the fish  saying:O king  having taken this fish I did not think fit to bear it to the market  although I am one who lives by the labour of his hands; but it seemed to me that it was worthy of thee and of thy monarchy: therefore I bring it and present it to thee. He then  being pleased at the words spoken  answered thus:Thou didst exceedingly well  and double thanks are due to thee  for thy words and also for thy gift; and we invite thee to come to dinner. The fisherman then  thinking this a great thing  went away to this house; and the servants as they were cutting up the fish found in its belly the signet-ring of Polycrates. Then as soon as they had seen it and taken it up  they bore it rejoicing to Polycrates  and giving him the signet-ring they told him in what manner it had been found: and he perceiving that the matter was of God  wrote upon paper all that he had done and all that had happened to him  and having written he despatched it to Egypt.,mashup

Therefore he sent an envoy to him in Samos and said that he broke off the guest- friendship; and this he did lest when a fearful and great mishap befell Polycrates  he might himself be grieved in his soul as for a man who was his guest.,mashup

It was this Polycrates then  prosperous in all things  against whom the Lacedemonians were making an expedition  being invited by those Samians who afterwards settled at Kydonia in Crete  to come to their assistance. Now Polycrates had sent an envoy to Cambyses the son of Cyrus without the knowledge of the Samians  as he was gathering an army to go against Egypt  and had asked him to send to him in Samos and to ask for an armed force. So Cambyses hearing this very readily sent to Samos to ask Polycrates to send a naval force with him against Egypt: and Polycrates selected of the citizens those whom he most suspected of desiring to rise against him and sent them away in forty triremes  charging Cambyses not to send them back.,mashup

Now some say that those of the Samians who were sent away by Polycrates never reached Egypt  but when they arrived on their voyage at Carpathos  they considered with themselves  and resolved not to sail on any further: others say that they reached Egypt and being kept under guard there  they made their escape from thence. Then  as they were sailing in to Samos  Polycrates encountered them with ships and engaged battle with them; and those who were returning home had the better and landed in the island; but having fought a land-battle in the island  they were worsted  and so sailed to Lacedemon. Some however say that those from Egypt defeated Polycrates in the battle; but this in my opinion is not correct  for there would have been no need for them to invite the assistance of the Lacedemonians if they had been able by themselves to bring Polycrates to terms. Moreover  it is not reasonable either  seeing that he had foreign mercenaries and native archers very many in number  to suppose that he was worsted by the returning Samians  who were but few. Then Polycrates gathered together the children and wives of his subjects and confined them in the ship- sheds  keeping them ready so that  if it should prove that his subjects deserted to the side of the returning exiles  he might burn them with the sheds.,mashup

When those of the Samians who had been driven out by Polycrates reached Sparta  they were introduced before the magistrates and spoke at length  being urgent in their request. The magistrates however at the first introduction replied that they had forgotten the things which had been spoken at the beginning  and did not understand those which were spoken at the end. After this they were introduced a second time  and bringing with them a bag they said nothing else but this  namely that the bag was in want of meal; to which the others replied that they had overdone it with the bag. However  they resolved to help them.,mashup

Then the Lacedemonians prepared a force and made expedition to Samos  in repayment of former services  as the Samians say  because the Samians had first helped them with ships against the Messenians; but the Lacedemonians say that they made the expedition not so much from desire to help the Samians at their request  as to take vengeance on their own behalf for the robbery of the mixing-bowl which they had been bearing as a gift to Croesus  and of the corslet which Amasis the king of Egypt had sent as a gift to them; for the Samians had carried off the corslet also in the year before they took the bowl; and it was of linen with many figures woven into it and embroidered with gold and with cotton; and each thread of this corslet is worthy of admiration  for that being itself fine it has in it three hundred and sixty fibres  all plain to view.

The Corinthians also took part with zeal in this expedition against Samos  that it might be carried out; for there had been an offence perpetrated against them also by the Samians a generation before the time of this expedition and about the same time as the robbery of the bowl. Periander the son of Kypselos had despatched three hundred sons of the chief men of Corcyra to Alyattes at Sardis to be made eunuchs; and when the Corinthians who were conducting the boys had put in to Samos  the Samians  being informed of the story and for what purpose they were being conducted to Sardis  first instructed the boys to lay hold of the temple of Artemis  and then they refused to permit the Corinthians to drag the suppliants away from the temple: and as the Corinthians cut the boys off from supplies of food  the Samians made a festival  which they celebrate even to the present time in the same manner: for when night came on  as long as the boys were suppliants they arranged dances of maidens and youths  and in arranging the dances they made it a rule of the festival that sweet cakes of sesame and honey should be carried  in order that the Corcyrean boys might snatch them and so have support; and this went on so long that at last the Corinthians who had charge of the boys departed and went away; and as for the boys  the Samians carried them back to Corcyra.,mashup

Now Periander had chosen out the sons of the chief men of Corcyra and was sending them to Sardis to be made eunuchs  in order that he might have revenge; since the Corcyreans had first begun the offence and had done to him a deed of reckless wrong. For after Periander had killed his wife Melissa  it chanced to him to experience another misfortune in addition to that which had happened to him already  and this was as follows:— He had by Melissa two sons  the one of seventeen and the other of eighteen years. These sons their mother's father Procles  who was despot of Epidauros  sent for to himself and kindly entertained  as was to be expected seeing that they were the sons of his own daughter; and when he was sending them back  he said in taking leave of them:Do ye know  boys  who it was that killed your mother ? Of this saying the elder of them took no account  but the younger  whose name was Lycophron  was grieved so greatly at hearing it  that when he reached Corinth again he would neither address his father  nor speak to him when his father would have conversed with him  nor give any reply when he asked questions  regarding him as the murderer of his mother. At length Periander being enraged with his son drove him forth out of his house.,mashup

And having driven him forth  he asked of the elder son what his mother's father had said to them in his conversation. He then related how Procles had received them in a kindly manner  but of the saying which he had uttered when he parted from them he had no remembrance  since he had taken no note of it. So Periander said that it could not be but that he had suggested to them something  and urged him further with questions; and he after that remembered  and told of this also. Then Periander taking note of it and not desiring to show any indulgence  sent a messenger to those with whom the son who had been driven forth was living at that time  and forbade them to receive him into their houses; and whenever having been driven away from one house he came to another  he was driven away also from this  since Periander threatened those who received him  and commanded them to exclude him; and so being driven away again he would go to another house  where persons lived who were his friends  and they perhaps received him because he was the son of Periander  notwithstanding that they feared.,mashup

At last Periander made a proclamation that whosoever should either receive him into their houses or converse with him should be bound to pay a fine to Apollo  stating the amount that it should be. Accordingly  by reason of this proclamation no one was willing either to converse with him or to receive him into their house; and moreover even he himself did not think it fit to attempt it  since it had been forbidden  but he lay about in the porticoes enduring exposure: and on the fourth day after this  Periander seeing him fallen into squalid misery and starvation felt pity for him; and abating his anger he approached him and began to say:Son  which of these two is to be preferred  the fortune which thou dost now experience and possess  or to inherit the power and wealth which I possess now  by being submissive to thy father's will? Thou however  being my son and the prince of wealthy Corinth  didst choose nevertheless the life of a vagabond by making opposition and displaying anger against him with whom it behoved thee least to deal so; for if any misfortune happened in those matters  for which cause thou hast suspicion against me  this has happened to me first  and I am sharer in the misfortune more than others  inasmuch as I did the deed myself. Do thou however  having learnt by how much to be envied is better than to be pitied  and at the same time what a grievous thing it is to be angry against thy parents and against those who are stronger than thou  come back now to the house. Periander with these words endeavoured to restrain him; but he answered nothing else to his father  but said only that he ought to pay a fine to the god for having come to speech with him. Then Periander  perceiving that the malady of his son was hopeless and could not be overcome  despatched a ship to Corcyra  and so sent him away out of his sight  for he was ruler also of that island; and having sent him away  Periander proceeded to make war against his father-in-law Procles  esteeming him most to blame for the condition in which he was; and he took Epidauros and took also Procles himself and made him a prisoner.,mashup

Lycophron however did not deign even to give an answer to the bearer of his message. Then Periander  clinging still in affection to the youth  sent to him next his own daughter  the sister of Lycophron  supposing that he would yield to her persuasion more than to that of others; and she arrived there and spoke to him thus:Boy  dost thou desire that both the despotism should fall to others  and also the substance of thy father  carried off as plunder  rather than that thou shouldest return back and possess them? Come back to thy home: cease to torment thyself. Pride is a mischievous possession. Heal not evil with evil. Many prefer that which is reasonable to that which is strictly just; and many ere now in seeking the things of their mother have lost the things of their father. Despotism is an insecure thing  and many desire it: moreover he is now an old man and past his prime. Give not thy good things unto others. She thus said to him the most persuasive things  having been before instructed by her father: but he in answer said  that he would never come to Corinth so long as he heard that his father was yet alive. When she had reported this  Periander the third time sent an envoy  and said that he desired himself to come to Corcyra  exhorting Lycophron at the same time to come back to Corinth and to be his successor on the throne. The son having agreed to return on these terms  Periander was preparing to sail to Corcyra and his son to Corinth; but the Corcyreans  having learnt all that had taken place  put the young man to death  in order that Periander might not come to their land. For this cause it was that Periander took vengeance on those of Corcyra.,mashup

The Lacedemonians then had come with a great armament and were besieging Samos; and having made an attack upon the wall  they occupied the tower which stands by the sea in the suburb of the city  but afterwards when Polycrates came up to the rescue with a large body they were driven away from it. Meanwhile by the upper tower which is upon the ridge of the mountain there had come out to the fight the foreign mercenaries and many of the Samians themselves  and these stood their ground against the Lacedemonians for a short while and then began to fly backwards; and the Lacedemonians followed and were slaying them.,mashup

Those of the Samians who had made the expedition against Polycrates themselves also sailed away  when the Lacedemonians were about to desert them  and came to Siphnos: for they were in want of money  and the people of Siphnos were then at their greatest height of prosperity and possessed wealth more than all the other islanders  since they had in their island mines of gold and silver  so that there is a treasury dedicated at Delphi with the tithe of the money which came in from these mines  and furnished in a manner equal to the wealthiest of these treasuries: and the people used to divide among themselves the money which came in from the mines every year. So when they were establishing the treasury  they consulted the Oracle as to whether their present prosperity was capable of remaining with them for a long time  and the Pythian prophetess gave them this reply:But when with white shall be shining the hall of the city in Siphnos  And when the market is white of brow  one wary is needed Then  to beware of an army of wood and a red-coloured herald. Now just at that time the market-place and city hall of the Siphnians had been decorated with Parian marble.,mashup

This oracle they were not able to understand either then at first or when the Samians had arrived: for as soon as the Samians were putting in to Siphnos they sent one of their ships to bear envoys to the city: now in old times all ships were painted with red  and this was that which the Pythian prophetess was declaring beforehand to the Siphnians  bidding them guard against thearmy of wood and thered-coloured herald. The messengers accordingly came and asked the Siphnians to lend them ten talents; and as they refused to lend to them  the Samians began to lay waste their lands: so when they were informed of it  forthwith the Siphnians came to the rescue  and having engaged battle with them were defeated  and many of them were cut off by the Samians and shut out of the city; and the Samians after this imposed upon them a payment of a hundred talents.,mashup

Here they remained and were prosperous for five years  so much so that they were the builders of the temples which are now existing in Kydonia  and also of the house of Dictyna. In the sixth year however the Eginetans together with the Cretans conquered them in a sea-fight and brought them to slavery; and they cut off the prows of their ships  which were shaped like boars  and dedicated them in the temple of Athene in Egina. This the Eginetans did because they had a grudge against the Samians; for the Samians had first made expedition against Egina  when Amphicrates was king in Samos  and had done much hurt to the Eginetans and suffered much hurt also from them. Such was the cause of this event:,mashup

This is one of the three; and the second is a mole in the sea about the harbour  going down to a depth of as much as twenty fathoms; and the length of the mole is more than two furlongs. The third work which they have executed is a temple larger than all the other temples of which we know. Of this the first designer was Rhoicos the son of Philes  a native of Samos. For this reason I have spoken at greater length of the Samians.,mashup

Now while Cambyses the son of Cyrus was spending a long time in Egypt and had gone out of his right mind  there rose up against him two brothers  Magians  of whom the one had been left behind by Cambyses as caretaker of his household. This man  I say  rose up against him perceiving that the occurrence of the death of Smerdis was being kept secret  and that there were but few of the Persians who were aware of it  while the greater number believed without doubt that he was still alive. Therefore he endeavoured to obtain the kingdom  and he formed his plan as follows:— he had a brother (that one who  as I said  rose up with him against Cambyses )  and this man in form very closely resembled Smerdis the son of Cyrus  whom Cambyses had slain  being his own brother. He was like Smerdis  I say  in form  and not only so but he had the same name  Smerdis. Having persuaded this man that he would manage everything for him  the Magian Patizeithes brought him and seated him upon the royal throne: and having so done he sent heralds about to the various provinces  and among others one to the army in Egypt  to proclaim to them that they must obey Smerdis the son of Cyrus for the future instead of Cambyses.,mashup

So then the other heralds made this proclamation  and also the one who was appointed to go to Egypt  finding Cambyses and his army at Agbatana in Syria  stood in the midst and began to proclaim that which had been commanded to him by the Magian. Hearing this from the herald  and supposing that the herald was speaking the truth and that he had himself been betrayed by Prexaspes  that is to say  that when Prexaspes was sent to kill Smerdis he had not done so  Cambyses looked upon Prexaspes and said:Prexaspes  was it thus that thou didst perform for me the thing which I gave over to thee to do ? and he said:Master  the saying is not true that Smerdis thy brother has risen up against thee  nor that thou wilt have any contention arising from him  either great or small: for I myself  having done that which thou didst command me to do  buried him with my own hands. If therefore the dead have risen again to life  then thou mayest expect that Astyages also the Mede will rise up against thee; but if it is as it was beforetime  there is no fear now that any trouble shall spring up for you  at least from him. Now therefore I think it well that some should pursue after the herald and examine him  asking from whom he has come to proclaim to us that we are to obey Smerdis as king.,mashup

When Prexaspes had thus spoken  Cambyses was pleased with the advice  and accordingly the herald was pursued forthwith and returned. Then when he had come back  Prexaspes asked him as follows:Man  thou sayest that thou art come as a messenger from Smerdis the son of Cyrus: now therefore speak the truth and go away in peace. I ask thee whether Smerdis himself appeared before thine eyes and charged thee to say this  or some one of those who serve him. He said:Smerdis the son of Cyrus I have never yet seen  since the day that king Cambyses marched to Egypt: but the Magian whom Cambyses appointed to be guardian of his household  he  I say  gave me this charge  saying that Smerdis the son of Cyrus was he who laid the command upon me to speak these things to you. Thus he spoke to them  adding no falsehoods to the first  and Cambyses said:Prexaspes  thou hast done that which was commanded thee like an honest man  and hast escaped censure; but who of the Persians may this be who has risen up against me and usurped the name of Smerdis ? He said:I seem to myself  O king  to have understanding of this which has come to pass: the Magians have risen against thee  Patizeithes namely  whom thou didst leave as caretaker of thy household  and his brother Smerdis.,mashup

Then Cambyses  when he heard the name of Smerdis  perceived at once the true meaning of this report and of the dream  for he thought in his sleep that some one had reported to him that Smerdis was sitting upon the royal throne and had touched the heaven with his head: and perceiving that he had slain his brother without need  he began to lament for Smerdis; and having lamented for him and sorrowed greatly for the whole mishap  he was leaping upon his horse  meaning as quickly as possible to march his army to Susa against the Magian; and as he leapt upon his horse  the cap of his sword-sheath fell off  and the sword being left bare struck his thigh. Having been wounded then in the same part where he had formerly struck Apis the god of the Egyptians  and believing that he had been struck with a mortal blow  Cambyses asked what was the name of that town  and they saidAgbatana. Now even before this he had been informed by the Oracle at the city of Buto that in Agbatana he should bring his life to an end: and he supposed that he should die of old age in Agbatana in Media  where was his chief seat of power; but the oracle  it appeared  meant in Agbatana of Syria. So when by questioning now he learnt the name of the town  being struck with fear both by the calamity caused by the Magian and at the same time by the wound  he came to his right mind  and understanding the meaning of the oracle he said:Here it is fated that Cambyses the son of Cyrus shall end his life.,mashup

Being in Egypt I saw a vision in my sleep  which I would I had never seen  and it seemed to me that a messenger came from home and reported to me that Smerdis was sitting upon the royal throne and had touched the heaven with his head. Fearing then lest I should be deprived of my power by my brother  I acted quickly rather than wisely; for it seems that it is not possible for man to avert that which is destined to come to pass. I therefore  fool that I was  sent away Prexaspes to Susa to kill Smerdis; and when this great evil had been done  I lived in security  never considering the danger that some other man might at some time rise up against me  now that Smerdis had been removed: and altogether missing the mark of that which was about to happen  I have both made myself the murderer of my brother  when there was no need  and I have been deprived none the less of the kingdom; for it was in fact Smerdis the Magian of whom the divine power declared to me beforehand in the vision that he should rise up against me. So then  as I say  this deed has been done by me  and ye must imagine that ye no longer have Smerdis the son of Cyrus alive: but it is in truth the Magians who are masters of your kingdom  he whom I left as guardian of my household and his brother Smerdis. The man then who ought above all others to have taken vengeance on my behalf for the dishonour which I have suffered from the Magians  has ended his life by an unholy death received from the hands of those who were his nearest of kin; and since he is no more  it becomes most needful for me  as the thing next best of those which remain  to charge you  O Persians  with that which dying I desire should be done for me. This then I lay upon you  calling upon the gods of the royal house to witness it — upon you and most of all upon those of the Achaemenidai who are present here — that ye do not permit the return of the chief power to the Medes  but that if they have acquired it by craft  by craft they be deprived of it by you  or if they have conquered it by any kind of force  by force and by a strong hand ye recover it. And if ye do this  may the earth bring forth her produce and may your wives and your cattle be fruitful  while ye remain free for ever; but if ye do not recover the power nor attempt to recover it  I pray that curses the contrary of these blessings may come upon you  and moreover that each man of the Persians may have an end to his life like that which has come upon me. Then as soon as he had finished speaking these things  Cambyses began to bewail and make lamentation for all his fortunes.,mashup

And the Persians  when they saw that the king had begun to bewail himself  both rent the garments which they wore and made lamentation without stint. After this  when the bone had become diseased and the thigh had mortified  Cambyses the son of Cyrus was carried off by the wound  having reigned in all seven years and five months  and being absolutely childless both of male and female offspring. The Persians meanwhile who were present there were very little disposed to believe that the power was in the hands of the Magians: on the contrary  they were surely convinced that Cambyses had said that which he said about the death of Smerdis to deceive them  in order that all the Persians might be moved to war against him. These then were surely convinced that Smerdis the son of Cyrus was established to be king; for Prexaspes also very strongly denied that he had slain Smerdis  since it was not safe  now that Cambyses was dead  for him to say that he had destroyed with his own hand the son of Cyrus.,mashup

Thus when Cambyses had brought his life to an end  the Magian became king without disturbance  usurping the place of his namesake Smerdis the son of Cyrus; and he reigned during the seven months which were wanting yet to Cambyses for the completion of the eight years: and during them he performed acts of great benefit to all his subjects  so that after his death all those in Asia except the Persians themselves mourned for his loss: for the Magian sent messengers abroad to every nation over which he ruled  and proclaimed freedom from military service and from tribute for three years.,mashup

This proclamation  I say  he made at once when he established himself upon the throne: but in the eighth month it was discovered who he was in the following manner:— There was one Otanes the son of Pharnaspes  in birth and in wealth not inferior to any of the Persians. This Otanes was the first who had had suspicion of the Magian  that he was not Smerdis the son of Cyrus but the person that he really was  drawing his inference from these facts  namely that he never went abroad out of the fortress  and that he did not summon into his presence any of the honourable men among the Persians: and having formed a suspicion of him  he proceeded to do as follows:— Cambyses had taken to wife his daughter  whose name was Phaidyme; and this same daughter the Magian at that time was keeping as his wife and living with her as with all the rest also of the wives of Cambyses. Otanes therefore sent a message to this daughter and asked her who the man was by whose side she slept  whether Smerdis the son of Cyrus or some other. She sent back word to him saying that she did not know  for she had never seen Smerdis the son of Cyrus  nor did she know otherwise who he was who lived with her. Otanes then sent a second time and said:If thou dost not thyself know Smerdis the son of Cyrus  then do thou ask of Atossa who this man is  with whom both she and thou live as wives; for assuredly it must be that she knows her own brother.,mashup

To this the daughter sent back word:I am not able either to come to speech with Atossa or to see any other of the women who live here with me; for as soon as this man  whosoever he may be  succeeded to the kingdom  he separated us and placed us in different apartments by ourselves. When Otanes heard this  the matter became more and more clear to him  and he sent another message in to her  which said:Daughter  it is right for thee  nobly born as thou art  to undertake any risk which thy father bids thee take upon thee: for if in truth this is not Smerdis the son of Cyrus but the man whom I suppose  he ought not to escape with impunity either for taking thee to his bed or for holding the dominion of Persians  but he must pay the penalty. Now therefore do as I say. When he sleeps by thee and thou perceivest that he is sound asleep  feel his ears; and if it prove that he has ears  then believe that thou art living with Smerdis the son of Cyrus  but if not  believe that it is with the Magian Smerdis. To this Phaidyme sent an answer saying that  if she should do so  she would run a great risk; for supposing that he should chance not to have his ears  and she were detected feeling for them  she was well assured that he would put her to death; but nevertheless she would do this. So she undertook to do this for her father: but as for this Magian Smerdis  he had had his ears cut off by Cyrus the son of Cambyses when he was king  for some grave offence. This Phaidyme then  the daughter of Otanes  proceeding to perform all that she had undertaken for her father  when her turn came to go to the Magian (for the wives of the Persians go in to them regularly each in her turn )  came and lay down beside him: and when the Magian was in deep sleep  she felt his ears; and perceiving not with difficulty but easily that her husband had no ears  so soon as it became day she sent and informed her father of that which had taken place.,mashup

Then Otanes took to him Aspathines and Gobryas  who were leading men among the Persians and also his own most trusted friends  and related to them the whole matter: and they  as it then appeared  had suspicions also themselves that it was so; and when Otanes reported this to them  they readily accepted his proposals. Then it was resolved by them that each one should associate with himself that man of the Persians whom he trusted most; so Otanes brought in Intaphrenes  Gobryas brought in Megabyzos  and Aspathines brought in Hydarnes. When they had thus become six  Dareios the son of Hystaspes arrived at Susa  having come from the land of Persia  for of this his father was governor. Accordingly when he came  the six men of the Persians resolved to associate Dareios also with themselves.,mashup

These then having come together  being seven in number  gave pledges of faith to one another and deliberated together; and when it came to Dareios to declare his opinion  he spoke to them as follows:I thought that I alone knew this  namely that it was the Magian who was reigning as king and that Smerdis the son of Cyrus had brought his life to an end; and for this very reason I am come with earnest purpose to contrive death for the Magian. Since however it has come to pass that ye also know and not I alone  I think it well to act at once and not to put the matter off  for that is not the better way. To this replied Otanes:Son of Hystaspes  thou art the scion of a noble stock  and thou art showing thyself  as it seems  in no way inferior to thy father: do not however hasten this enterprise so much without consideration  but take it up more prudently; for we must first become more in numbers  and then undertake the matter. In answer to this Dareios said:Men who are here present  if ye shall follow the way suggested by Otanes  know that ye will perish miserably; for some one will carry word to the Magian  getting gain thereby privately for himself. Your best way would have been to do this action upon your own risk alone; but since it seemed good to you to refer the matter to a greater number  and ye communicated it to me  either let us do the deed to-day  or be ye assured that if this present day shall pass by  none other shall prevent me as your accuser  but I will myself tell these things to the Magian.,mashup

To this Otanes  when he saw Dareios in violent haste  replied:Since thou dost compel us to hasten the matter and dost not permit us to delay  come expound to us thyself in what manner we shall pass into the palace and lay hands upon them: for that there are guards set in various parts  thou knowest probably thyself as well as we  if not from sight at least from hearsay; and in what manner shall we pass through these ? Dareios made reply with these words:Otanes  there are many things in sooth which it is not possible to set forth in speech  but only in deed; and other things there are which in speech can be set forth  but from them comes no famous deed. Know ye however that the guards which are set are not difficult to pass: for in the first place  we being what we are  there is no one who will not let us go by  partly  as may be supposed  from having respect for us  and partly also perhaps from fear; and secondly I have myself a most specious pretext by means of which we may pass by; for I shall say that I am just now come from the Persian land and desire to declare to the king a certain message from my father: for where it is necessary that a lie be spoken  let it be spoken; seeing that we all aim at the same object  both they who lie and they who always speak the truth; those lie whenever they are likely to gain anything by persuading with their lies  and these tell the truth in order that they may draw to themselves gain by the truth  and that things may be entrusted to them more readily. Thus  while practising different ways  we aim all at the same thing. If however they were not likely to make any gain by it  the truth-teller would lie and the liar would speak the truth  with indifference. Whosoever then of the door-keepers shall let us pass by of his own free will  for him it shall be the better afterwards; but whosoever shall endeavour to oppose our passage  let him then and there be marked as our enemy  and after that let us push in and set about our work.,mashup

Moreover all those of you who stood by the side of Cambyses when he was sick remember assuredly what he laid upon the Persians as he was bringing his life to an end  if they should not attempt to win back the power; and this we did not accept then  but supposed that Cambyses had spoken in order to deceive us. Now therefore I give my vote that we follow the opinion of Dareios  and that we do not depart from this assembly to go anywhither else but straight to attack the Magian.

Now while these were thus taking counsel together  it was coming to pass by coincidence as follows:— The Magians taking counsel together had resolved to join Prexaspes with themselves as a friend  both because he had suffered grievous wrong from Cambyses  who had killed his son by shooting him  and because he alone knew for a certainty of the death of Smerdis the son of Cyrus  having killed him with his own hands  and finally because Prexaspes was in very great repute among the Persians. For these reasons they summoned him and endeavoured to win him to be their friend  engaging him by pledge and with oaths  that he would assuredly keep to himself and not reveal to any man the deception which had been practised by them upon the Persians  and promising to give him things innumerable in return. After Prexaspes had promised to do this  the Magians  having persuaded him so far  proposed to him a second thing  and said that they would call together all the Persians to come up to the wall of the palace  and bade him go up upon a tower and address them  saying that they were living under the rule of Smerdis the son of Cyrus and no other. This they so enjoined because they supposed that he had the greatest credit among the Persians  and because he had frequently declared the opinion that Smerdis the son of Cyrus was still alive  and had denied that he had slain him.,mashup

Ὁ δὲ τῶν μὲν δὴ ἐκεῖνοι προσεδέοντο αὐτοῦ  τούτων μὲν ἑκὼν ἐπελήθετο  ἀρξάμενος δὲ ἀπ᾽ Ἀχαιμένεος ἐγενεηλόγησε τὴν πατριὴν τὴν Κύρου· μετὰ δέ  ὡς ἐς τοῦτον κατέβη  τελευτῶν ἔλεγε ὅσα ἀγαθὰ Κῦρος Πέρσας πεποιήκοι.

When Prexaspes said that he was ready to do this also  the Magians having called together the Persians caused him to go up upon a tower and bade him address them. Then he chose to forget those things which they asked of him  and beginning with Achaimenes he traced the descent of Cyrus on the father's side  and then  when he came down to Cyrus  he related at last what great benefits he had conferred upon the Persians; and having gone through this recital he proceeded to declare the truth  saying that formerly he kept it secret  since it was not safe for him to tell of that which had been done  but at the present time he was compelled to make it known. He proceeded to say how he had himself slain Smerdis the son of Cyrus  being compelled by Cambyses  and that it was the Magians who were now ruling. Then he made imprecation of many evils on the Persians  if they did not win back again the power and take vengeance upon the Magians  and upon that he let himself fall down from the tower head foremost. Thus Prexaspes ended his life  having been throughout his time a man of repute.,mashup

Now the seven of the Persians  when they had resolved forthwith to lay hands upon the Magians and not to delay  made prayer to the gods and went  knowing nothing of that which had been done with regard to Prexaspes: and as they were going and were in the middle of their course  they heard that which had happened about Prexaspes. Upon that they retired out of the way and again considered with themselves  Otanes and his supporters strongly urging that they should delay and not set to the work when things were thus disturbed  while Dareios and those of his party urged that they should go forthwith and do that which had been resolved  and not delay. Then while they were contending  there appeared seven pairs of hawks pursuing two pairs of vultures  plucking out their feathers and tearing them. Seeing this the seven all approved the opinion of Dareios and thereupon they went to the king's palace  encouraged by the sight of the birds.,mashup

When they appeared at the gates  it happened nearly as Dareios supposed  for the guards  having respect for men who were chief among the Persians  and not suspecting that anything would be done by them of the kind proposed  allowed them to pass in under the guiding of heaven  and none asked them any question. Then when they had passed into the court  they met the eunuchs who bore in the messages to the king; and these inquired of them for what purpose they had come  and at the same time they threatened with punishment the keepers of the gates for having let them pass in  and tried to stop the seven when they attempted to go forward. Then they gave the word to one another and drawing their daggers stabbed these men there upon the spot  who tried to stop them  and themselves went running on towards the chamber of the men.,mashup

So when they saw that the eunuchs had been attacked and were crying aloud  they ran back both of them  and perceiving that which was being done they turned to self-defence: and one of them got down his bow and arrows before he was attacked  while the other had recourse to his spear. Then they engaged in combat with one another; and that one of them who had taken up his bow and arrows found them of no use  since his enemies were close at hand and pressed hard upon him  but the other defended himself with his spear  and first he struck Aspathines in the thigh  and then Intaphrenes in the eye; and Intaphrenes lost his eye by reason of the wound  but his life he did not lose. These then were wounded by one of the Magians  but the other  when his bow and arrows proved useless to him  fled into a bedchamber which opened into the chamber of the men  intending to close the door; and with him there rushed in two of the seven  Dareios and Gobryas. And when Gobryas was locked together in combat with the Magian  Dareios stood by and was at a loss what to do  because it was dark  and he was afraid lest he should strike Gobryas. Then seeing him standing by idle  Gobryas asked why he did not use his hands  and he said:Because I am afraid lest I may strike thee: and Gobryas answered:Thrust with thy sword even though it stab through us both. So Dareios was persuaded  and he thrust with his danger and happened to hit the Magian.,mashup

So the Persians when they heard of that which had been brought to pass by the seven and of the deceit of the Magians  thought good themselves also to do the same  and drawing their daggers they killed the Magians wherever they found one; so that if night had not come on and stopped them  they would not have left a single Magian alive. This day the Persians celebrate in common more than all other days  and upon it they keep a great festival which is called by the Persians the festival of the slaughter of the Magians  on which no Magian is permitted to appear abroad  but the Magians keep themselves within their houses throughout that day.,mashup

When the tumult had subsided and more than five days had elapsed  those who had risen against the Magians began to take counsel about the general state  and there were spoken speeches which some of the Hellenes do not believe were really uttered  but spoken they were nevertheless. On the one hand Otanes urged that they should resign the government into the hands of the whole body of the Persians  and his words were as follows:To me it seems best that no single one of us should henceforth be ruler  for that is neither pleasant nor profitable. Ye saw the insolent temper of Cambyses  to what lengths it went  and ye have had experience also of the insolence of the Magian: and how should the rule of one alone be a well-ordered thing  seeing that the monarch may do what he desires without rendering any account of his acts? Even the best of all men  if he were placed in this disposition  would be caused by it to change from his wonted disposition: for insolence is engendered in him by the good things which he possesses  and envy is implanted in man from the beginning; and having these two things  he has all vice: for he does many deeds of reckless wrong  partly moved by insolence proceeding from satiety  and partly by envy. And yet a despot at least ought to have been free from envy  seeing that he has all manner of good things. He is however naturally in just the opposite temper towards his subjects; for he grudges to the nobles that they should survive and live  but delights in the basest of citizens  and he is more ready than any other man to receive calumnies. Then of all things he is the most inconsistent; for if you express admiration of him moderately  he is offended that no very great court is paid to him  whereas if you pay court to him extravagantly  he is offended with you for being a flatterer. And the most important matter of all is that which I am about to say:— he disturbs the customs handed down from our fathers  he is a ravisher of women  and he puts men to death without trial. On the other hand the rule of many has first a name attaching to it which is the fairest of all names  that is to say 'Equality'; next  the multitude does none of those things which the monarch does: offices of state are exercised by lot  and the magistrates are compelled to render account of their action: and finally all matters of deliberation are referred to the public assembly. I therefore give as my opinion that we let monarchy go and increase the power of the multitude; for in the many is contained everything.,mashup

This was the opinion expressed by Otanes; but Megabyzos urged that they should entrust matters to the rule of a few  saying these words:That which Otanes said in opposition to a tyranny  let it be counted as said for me also  but in that which he said urging that we should make over the power to the multitude  he has missed the best counsel: for nothing is more senseless or insolent than a worthless crowd; and for men flying from the insolence of a despot to fall into that of unrestrained popular power  is by no means to be endured: for he  if he does anything  does it knowing what he does  but the people cannot even know; for how can that know which has neither been taught anything noble by others nor perceived anything of itself  but pushes on matters with violent impulse and without understanding  like a torrent stream? Rule of the people then let them adopt who are foes to the Persians; but let us choose a company of the best men  and to them attach the chief power; for in the number of these we shall ourselves also be  and it is likely that the resolutions taken by the best men will be the best.,mashup

This was the opinion expressed by Megabyzos; and thirdly Dareios proceeded to declare his opinion  saying:To me it seems that in those things which Megabyzos said with regard to the multitude he spoke rightly  but in those which he said with regard to the rule of a few  not rightly: for whereas there are three things set before us  and each is supposed to be the best in its own kind  that is to say a good popular government  and the rule of a few  and thirdly the rule of one  I say that this last is by far superior to the others; for nothing better can be found than the rule of an individual man of the best kind; seeing that using the best judgment he would be guardian of the multitude without reproach; and resolutions directed against enemies would so best be kept secret. In an oligarchy however it happens often that many  while practising virtue with regard to the commonwealth  have strong private enmities arising among themselves; for as each man desires to be himself the leader and to prevail in counsels  they come to great enmities with one another  whence arise factions among them  and out of the factions comes murder  and from murder results the rule of one man; and thus it is shown in this instance by how much that is the best. Again  when the people rules  it is impossible that corruption should not arise  and when corruption arises in the commonwealth  there arise among the corrupt men not enmities but strong ties of friendship: for they who are acting corruptly to the injury of the commonwealth put their heads together secretly to do so. And this continues so until at last some one takes the leadership of the people and stops the course of such men. By reason of this the man of whom I speak is admired by the people  and being so admired he suddenly appears as monarch. Thus he too furnishes herein an example to prove that the rule of one is the best thing. Finally  to sum up all in a single word  whence arose the liberty which we possess  and who gave it to us? Was it a gift of the people or of an oligarchy or of a monarch? I therefore am of opinion that we  having been set free by one man  should preserve that form of rule  and in other respects also that we should not annul the customs of our fathers which are ordered well; for that is not the better way.,mashup

These three opinions then had been proposed  and the other four men of the seven gave their assent to the last. So when Otanes  who was desirous to give equality to the Persians  found his opinion defeated  he spoke to those assembled thus:Partisans  it is clear that some one of us must become king  selected either by casting lots  or by entrusting the decision to the multitude of the Persians and taking him whom it shall choose  or by some other means. I therefore shall not be a competitor with you  for I do not desire either to rule or to be ruled; and on this condition I withdraw from my claim to rule  namely that I shall not be ruled by any of you  either I myself or my descendants in future time. When he had said this  the six made agreement with him on those terms  and he was no longer a competitor with them  but withdrew from the assembly; and at the present time this house remains free alone of all the Persian houses  and submits to rule only so far as it wills to do so itself  not transgressing the laws of the Persians.,mashup

These were special gifts for Otanes; and this they also determined for all in common  namely that any one of the seven who wished might pass in to the royal palaces without any to bear in a message  unless the king happened to be sleeping with his wife; and that it should not be lawful for the king to marry from any other family  but only from those of the men who had made insurrection with him: and about the kingdom they determined this  namely that the man whose horse should first neigh at sunrise in the suburb of the city when they were mounted upon their horses  he should have the kingdom.,mashup

Now Dareios had a clever horse-keeper  whose name was Oibares. To this man  when they had left their assembly  Dareios spoke these words:Oibares  we have resolved to do about the kingdom thus  namely that the man whose horse first neighs at sunrise  when we are mounted upon our horses he shall be king. Now therefore  if thou hast any cleverness  contrive that we may obtain this prize  and not any other man. Oibares replied thus:If  my master  it depends in truth upon this whether thou be king or no  have confidence so far as concerns this and keep a good heart  for none other shall be king before thee; such charms have I at my command. Then Dareios said:If then thou hast any such trick  it is time to devise it and not to put things off  for our trial is to-morrow. Oibares therefore hearing this did as follows:— when night was coming on he took one of the mares  namely that one which the horse of Dareios preferred  and this he led into the suburb of the city and tied her up: then he brought to her the horse of Dareios  and having for some time led him round her  making him go so close by so as to touch the mare  at last he let the horse mount.,mashup

So Dareios the son of Hystaspes had been declared king; and in Asia all except the Arabians were his subjects  having been subdued by Cyrus and again afterwards by Cambyses. The Arabians however were never obedient to the Persians under conditions of subjection  but had become guest-friends when they let Cambyses pass by to Egypt: for against the will of the Arabians the Persians would not be able to invade Egypt. Moreover Dareios made the most noble marriages possible in the estimation of the Persians; for he married two daughters of Cyrus  Atossa and Artystone  of whom the one  Arossa  had before been the wife of Cambyses her brother and then afterwards of the Magian  while Artystone was a virgin; and besides them he married the daughter of Smerdis the son of Cyrus  whose name was Parmys; and he also took to wife the daughter of Otanes  her who had discovered the Magian; and all things became filled with his power. And first he caused to be a carving in stone  and set it up; and in it there was the figure of a man on horseback  and he wrote upon it writing to this effect:Dareios son of Hystaspes by the excellence of his horse  mentioning the name of it and of his horse-keeper Oibares obtained the kingdom of the Persians.,mashup

Having so done in Persia  he established twenty provinces  which the Persians themselves call  satrapies; and having established the provinces and set over them rulers  he appointed tribute to come to him from them according to races  joining also to the chief races those who dwelt on their borders  or passing beyond the immediate neighbours and assigning to various races those which lay more distant. He divided the provinces and the yearly payment of tribute as follows: and those of them who brought in silver were commanded to pay by the standard of the Babylonian talent  but those who brought in gold by the Euboic talent; now the Babylonian talent is equal to eight-and-seventy Euboic pounds. For in the reign of Cyrus  and again of Cambyses  nothing was fixed about tribute  but they used to bring gifts: and on account of this appointing of tribute and other things like this  the Persians say that Dareios was a shopkeeper  Cambyses a master  and Cyrus a father; the one because he dealt with all his affairs like a shopkeeper  the second because he was harsh and had little regard for any one  and the other because he was gentle and contrived for them all things good.,mashup

These were the provinces and the assessments of tribute: and the Persian land alone has not been mentioned by me as paying a contribution  for the Persians have their land to dwell in free from payment. The following moreover had no tribute fixed for them to pay  but brought gifts  namely the Ethiopians who border upon Egypt  whom Cambyses subdued as he marched against the Long-lived Ethiopians  those who dwell about Nysa  which is calledsacred  and who celebrate the festivals in honour of Dionysos: these Ethiopians and those who dwell near them have the same kind of seed as the Callantian Indians  and they have underground dwellings. These both together brought every other year  and continue to bring even to my own time  two quart measures of unmelted gold and two hundred blocks of ebony and five Ethiopian boys and twenty large elephant tusks. The Colchians also had set themselves among those who brought gifts  and with them those who border upon them extending as far as the range of the Caucasus (for the Persian rule extends as far as these mountains  but those who dwell in the parts beyond Caucasus toward the North Wind regard the Persians no longer ) — these  I say  continued to bring the gifts which they had fixed for themselves every four years even down to my own time  that is to say  a hundred boys and a hundred maidens. Finally  the Arabians brought a thousand talents of frankincense every year. Such were the gifts which these brought to the king apart from the tribute.,mashup

Now this great quantity of gold  out of which the Indians bring in to the king the gold-dust which has been mentioned  is obtained by them in a manner which I shall tell:— That part of the Indian land which is towards the rising sun is sand; for of all the peoples in Asia of which we know or about which any certain report is given  the Indians dwell furthest away towards the East and the sunrising; seeing that the country to the East of the Indians is desert on account of the sand. Now there are many tribes of Indians  and they do not agree with one another in language; and some of them are pastoral and others not so  and some dwell in the swamps of the river and feed upon raw fish  which they catch by fishing from boats made of cane; and each boat is made of one joint of cane. These Indians of which I speak wear clothing made of rushes: they gather and cut the rushes from the river and then weave them together into a kind of mat and put it on like a corslet.,mashup

Others of the Indians  dwelling to the East of these  are pastoral and eat raw flesh: these are called Padaians  and they practise the following customs:— whenever any of their tribe falls ill  whether it be a woman or a man  if a man then the men who are his nearest associates put him to death  saying that he is wasting away with the disease and his flesh is being spoilt for them: and meanwhile he denies stoutly and says that he is not ill  but they do not agree with him; and after they have killed him they feast upon his flesh: but if it be a woman who falls ill  the women who are her greatest intimates do to her in the same manner as the men do in the other case. For in fact even if a man has come to old age they slay him and feast upon him; but very few of them come to be reckoned as old  for they kill every one who falls into sickness  before he reaches old age.,mashup

Others however of the Indians are on the borders of the city of Caspatyros and the country of Pactyike  dwelling towards the North of the other Indians; and they have a manner of living nearly the same as that of the Bactrians: these are the most warlike of the Indians  and these are they who make expeditions for the gold. For in the parts where they live it is desert on account of the sand; and in this desert and sandy tract are produced ants  which are in size smaller than dogs but larger than foxes  for there are some of them kept at the residence of the king of Persia  which are caught here. These ants then make their dwelling under ground and carry up the sand just in the same manner as the ants found in the land of the Hellenes  which they themselves also very much resemble in form; and the sand which is brought up contains gold. To obtain this sand the Indians make expeditions into the desert  each one having yoked together three camels  placing a female in the middle and a male like a trace-horse to draw by each side. On this female he mounts himself  having arranged carefully that she shall be taken to be yoked from young ones  the more lately born the better. For their female camels are not inferior to horses in speed  and moreover they are much more capable of bearing weights.,mashup

The Indians  I say  ride out to get the gold in the manner and with the kind of yoking which I have described  making calculations so that they may be engaged in carrying it off at the time when the greatest heat prevails; for the heat causes the ants to disappear underground. Now among these nations the sun is hottest in the morning hours  not at midday as with others  but from sunrise to the time of closing the market: and during this time it produces much greater heat than at midday in Hellas  so that it is said that then they drench themselves with water. Midday however has about equal degree of heat with the Indians as with other men  while after midday their sun becomes like the morning sun with other men  and after this  as it goes further away  it produces still greater coolness  until at last at sunset it makes the air very cool indeed.,mashup

So then the male camels  for they are inferior in speed of running to the females  if they drag behind are even let loose from the side of the female  one after the other; the females however  remembering the young which they left behind  do not show any slackness in their course. Thus it is that the Indians get most part of the gold  as the Persians say; there is however other gold also in their land obtained by digging  but in smaller quantities.,mashup

Then again Arabia is the furthest of inhabited lands in the direction of the midday  and in it alone of all lands grow frankincense and myrrh and cassia and cinnamon and gum-mastich. All these except myrrh are got with difficulty by the Arabians. Frankincense they collect by burning the storax  which is brought thence to the Hellenes by the Phenicians  by burning this  I say  so as to produce smoke they take it; for these trees which produce frankincense are guarded by winged serpents  small in size and of various colours  which watch in great numbers about each tree  of the same kind as those which attempt to invade Egypt: and they cannot be driven away from the trees by any other thing but only the smoke of storax.,mashup

The Arabians say also that all the world would have been by this time filled with these serpents  if that did not happen with regard to them which I knew happened with regard to vipers: and it seems that the Divine Providence  as indeed was to be expected  seeing that it is wise  has made all those animals prolific which are of cowardly spirit and good for food  in order that they may not be all eaten up and their race fail  whereas it has made those which are bold and noxious to have small progeny. For example  because the hare is hunted by every beast and bird as well as by man  therefore it is so very prolific as it is: and this is the only one of all beasts which becomes pregnant again before the former young are born  and has in its womb some of its young covered with fur and others bare; and while one is just being shaped in the matrix  another is being conceived. Thus it is in this case; whereas the lioness  which is the strongest and most courageous of creatures  produces one cub once only in her life; for when she produces young she casts out her womb together with her young; and the cause of it is this:— when the cub being within the mother begins to move about  then having claws by far sharper than those of any other beast he tears the womb  and as he grows larger he proceeds much further in his scratching: at last the time of birth approaches and there is now nothing at all left of it in a sound condition.,mashup

Just so also  if vipers and the winged serpents of the Arabians were produced in the ordinary course of their nature  man would not be able to live upon the earth; but as it is  when they couple with one another and the male is in the act of generation  as he lets go from him the seed  the female seizes hold of his neck  and fastening on to it does not relax her hold till she has eaten it through. The male then dies in the manner which I have said  but the female pays the penalty of retribution for the male in this manner:— the young while they are still in the womb take vengeance for their father by eating through their mother  and having eaten through her belly they thus make their way out for themselves. Other serpents however  which are not hurtful to man  produce eggs and hatch from them a very large number of offspring. Now vipers are distributed over all the earth; but the others  which are winged  are found in great numbers together in Arabia and in no other land: therefore it is that they appear to be numerous.,mashup

Cinnamon they collect in a yet more marvellous manner than this: for where it grows and what land produces it they are not able to tell  except only that some say (and it is a probable account ) that it grows in those regions where Dionysos was brought up; and they say that large birds carry those dried sticks which we have learnt from the Phenicians to call cinnamon  carry them  I say  to nests which are made of clay and stuck on to precipitous sides of mountains  which man can find no means of scaling. With regard to this then the Arabians practise the following contrivance:— they divide up the limbs of the oxen and asses that die and of their other beasts of burden  into pieces as large as convenient  and convey them to these places  and when they have laid them down not far from the nests  they withdraw to a distance from them: and the birds fly down and carry the limbs of the beasts of burden off to their nests; and these are not able to bear them  but break down and fall to the earth; and the men come up to them and collect the cinnamon. Thus cinnamon is collected and comes from this nation to the other countries of the world.,mashup

The other kind of sheep has the tail broad  even as much as a cubit in breadth.,mashup

Now there is a plain in Asia bounded by mountains on all sides  and through the mountains there are five clefts. This plain belonged once to the Chorasmians  and it lies on the borders of the Chorasmians themselves  the Hyrcanians  Parthians  Sarangians  and Thamanaians; but from the time that the Persians began to bear rule it belongs to the king. From this enclosing mountain of which I speak there flows a great river  and its name is Akes. This formerly watered the lands of these nations which have been mentioned  being divided into five streams and conducted through a separate cleft in the mountains to each separate nation; but from the time that they have come to be under the Persians they have suffered as follows:— the king built up the clefts in the mountains and set gates at each cleft; and so  since the water has been shut off from its outlet  the plain within the mountains is made into a sea  because the river runs into it and has no way out in any direction. Those therefore who in former times had been wont to make use of the water  not being able now to make use of it are in great trouble: for during the winter they have rain from heaven  as also other men have  but in the summer they desire to use the water when they sow millet and sesame seed. So then  the water not being granted to them  they come to the Persians both themselves and their wives  and standing at the gates of the king's court they cry and howl; and the king orders that for those who need it most  the gates which lead to their land shall be opened; and when their land has become satiated with drinking in the water  these gates are closed  and he orders the gates to be opened for others  that is to say those most needing it of the rest who remain: and  as I have heard  he exacts large sums of money for opening them  besides the regular tribute.,mashup

Thus it is with these matters: but of the seven men who had risen against the Magian  it happened to one  namely Intaphrenes  to be put to death immediately after their insurrection for an outrage which I shall relate. He desired to enter into the king's palace and confer with the king; for the law was in fact so  that those who had risen up against the Magian were permitted to go in to the king's presence without any one to announce them  unless the king happened to be lying with his wife. Accordingly Intaphrenes did not think it fit that any one should announce his coming; but as he was one of the seven  he desired to enter. The gatekeeper however and the bearer of messages endeavoured to prevent him  saying that the king was lying with his wife: but Intaphrenes believing that they were not speaking the truth  drew his sword and cut off their ears and their noses  and stringing these upon his horse's bridle he tied them round their necks and so let them go.,mashup

Upon this they showed themselves to the king and told the cause for which they had suffered this; and Dareios  fearing that the six might have done this by common design  sent for each one separately and made trial of his inclinations  as to whether he approved of that which had been done: and when he was fully assured that Intaphrenes had not done this in combination with them  he took both Intaphrenes himself and his sons and all his kinsmen  being much disposed to believe that he was plotting insurrection against him with the help of his relations; and having seized them he put them in bonds as for execution. Then the wife of Intaphrenes  coming constantly to the doors of the king's court  wept and bewailed herself; and by doing this continually after the same manner she moved Dareios to pity her. Accordingly he sent a messenger and said to her:Woman  king Dareios grants to thee to save from death one of thy kinsmen who are lying in bonds  whomsoever thou desirest of them all. She then  having considered with herself  answered thus:If in truth the king grants me the life of one  I choose of them all my brother. Dareios being informed of this  and marvelling at her speech  sent and addressed her thus:Woman  the king asks thee what was in thy mind  that thou didst leave thy husband and thy children to die  and didst choose thy brother to survive  seeing that he is surely less near to thee in blood than thy children  and less dear to thee than thy husband. She made answer:O king  I might  if heaven willed  have another husband and other children  if I should lose these; but another brother I could by no means have  seeing that my father and my mother are no longer alive. This was in my mind when I said those words. To Dareios then it seemed that the woman had spoken well  and he let go not only him for whose life she asked  but also the eldest of her sons because he was pleased with her: but all the others he slew. One therefore of the seven had perished immediately in the manner which has been related.,mashup

Now about the time of the sickness of Cambyses it had come to pass as follows:— There was one Oroites  a Persian  who had been appointed by Cyrus to be governor of the province of Sardis. This man had set his desire upon an unholy thing; for though from Polycrates the Samian he had never suffered anything nor heard any offensive word nor even seen him before that time  he desired to take him and put him to death for a reason of this kind  as most who report the matter say:— while Oroites and another Persian whose name was Mitrobates  ruler of the province of Daskyleion  were sitting at the door of the king's court  they came from words to strife with one another; and as they debated their several claims to excellence  Mitrobates taunting Oroites said:Dost  thou  count thyself a man  who didst never yet win for the king the island of Samos  which lies close to thy province  when it is so exceedingly easy of conquest that one of the natives of it rose up against the government with fifteen men-at-arms and got possession of the island  and is now despot of it ? Some say that because he heard this and was stung by the reproach  he formed the desire  not so much to take vengeance on him who said this  as to bring Polycrates to destruction at all costs  since by reason of him he was ill spoken of:,mashup

The cause then of the death of Polycrates is reported in these two different ways  and we may believe whichever of them we please. Oroites however  having his residence at that Magnesia which is situated upon the river Maiander  sent Myrsos the son of Gyges  a Lydian  to Samos bearing a message  since he had perceived the designs of Polycrates. For Polycrates was the first of the Hellenes of whom we have any knowledge  who set his mind upon having command of the sea  excepting Minos the Cnossian and any other who may have had command of the sea before his time. Of that which we call mortal race Polycrates was the first; and he had great expectation of becoming ruler of Ionia and of the islands. Oroites accordingly  having perceived that he had this design  sent a message to him and said thus:Oroites to Polycrates saith as follows: I hear that thou art making plans to get great power  and that thou hast not wealth according to thy high thoughts. Now therefore if thou shalt do as I shall say  thou wilt do well for thyself on the one hand  and also save me from destruction: for king Cambyses is planning death for me  and this is reported to me so that I cannot doubt it. Do thou then carry away out of danger both myself and with me my wealth; and of this keep a part for thyself and a part let me keep  and then so far as wealth may bring it about  thou shalt be ruler of all Hellas. And if thou dost not believe that which I say about the money  send some one  whosoever happens to be most trusted by thee  and to him I will show it.,mashup

Oroites accordingly  having heard that the person sent to examine might be expected soon to come  did as follows  that is to say  he filled eight chests with stones except a small depth at the very top of each  and laid gold above upon the stones; then he tied up the chests and kept them in readiness. So Maiandrios came and looked at them and brought back word to Polycrates:,mashup

Having seen this vision  she used every kind of endeavour to dissuade Polycrates from leaving his land to go to Oroites  and besides that  as he was going to his fifty-oared galley she accompanied his departure with prophetic words: and he threatened her that if he should return safe  she should remain unmarried for long; but she prayed that this might come to pass  for she desired rather  she said  to be unmarried for long than to be an orphan  having lost her father.,mashup

Polycrates however neglected every counsel and set sail to go to Oroites  taking with him  besides many others of his friends  Demokedes also the son of Calliphon  a man of Croton  who was a physician and practised his art better than any other man of is time. Then when he arrived at Magnesia  Polycrates was miserably put to death in a manner unworthy both of himself and of his high ambition: for excepting those who become despots of the Syracusans  not one besides of the Hellenic despots is worthy to be compared with Polycrates in magnificence. And when he had killed him in a manner not fit to be told  Oroites impaled his body: and of those who accompanied him  as many as were Samians he released  bidding them be grateful to him that they were free men; but all those of his company who were either allies or servants  he held in the estimation of slaves and kept them. Polycrates then being hung up accomplished wholly the vision of his daughter  for he was bathed by Zeus whenever it rained  and anointed by the Sun  giving forth moisture himself from his body.,mashup

To this end came the great prosperity of Polycrates  as Amasis the king of Egypt had foretold to him: but not long afterwards retribution overtook Oroites in his turn for the murder of Polycrates. For after the death of Cambyses and the reign of the Magians Oroites remained at Sardis and did no service to the Persians  when they had been deprived of their empire by the Medes; moreover during this time of disturbance he slew Mitrobates the governor in Daskyleion  who had brought up against him the matter of Polycrates as a reproach; and he slew also Cranaspes the son of Mitrobates  both men of repute among the Persians: and besides other various deeds of insolence  once when a bearer of messages had come to him from Dareios  not being pleased with the message which he brought he slew him as he was returning  having set men to lie in wait for him by the way; and having slain him he made away with the bodies both of the man and of his horse.,mashup

Dareios accordingly  when he had come to the throne  was desirous of taking vengeance upon Oroites for all his wrongdoings and especially for the murder of Mitrobates and his son. However he did not think it good to act openly and to send an army against him  since his own affairs were still in a disturbed state and he had only lately come to the throne  while he heard that the strength of Oroites was great  seeing that he had a bodyguard of a thousand Persian spearmen and was in possession of the divisions of Phrygia and Lydia and Ionia. Therefore Dareios contrived as follows:— having called together those of the Persians who were of most repute  he said to them:Persians  which of you all will undertake to perform this matter for me with wisdom  and not by force or with tumult? for where wisdom is wanted  there is no need of force. Which of you  I say  will either bring Oroites alive to me or slay him? for he never yet did any service to the Persians  and on the other hand he has done to them great evil. First he destroyed two of us  Mitrobates and his son; then he slays the men who go to summon him  sent by me  displaying insolence not to be endured. Before therefore he shall accomplish any other evil against the Persians  we must check his course by death.,mashup

Thus Dareios asked  and thirty men undertook the matter  each one separately desiring to do it himself; and Dareios stopped their contention and bade them cast lots: so when they cast lots  Bagaios the son of Artontes obtained the lot from among them all. Bagaios accordingly  having obtained the lot  did thus:— he wrote many papers dealing with various matters and on them set the seal of Dareios  and with them he went to Sardis. When he arrived there and came into the presence of Oroites  he took the covers off the papers one after another and gave them to the Royal Secretary to read; for all the governors of provinces have Royal Secretaries. Now Bagaios thus gave the papers in order to make trial of the spearmen of the guard  whether they would accept the motion to revolt from Oroites; and seeing that they paid great reverence to the papers and still more to the words which were recited from them  he gave another paper in which were contained these words:Persians  king Dareios forbids you to serve as guards to Oroites: and they hearing this lowered to him the points of their spears. Then Bagaios  seeing that in this they were obedient to the paper  took courage upon that and gave the last of the papers to the secretary; and in it was written:King Dareios commands the Persians who are in Sardis to slay Oroites. So the spearmen of the guard  when they heard this  drew their swords and slew him forthwith. Thus did retribution for the murder of Polycrates the Samian overtake Oroites.,mashup

When the wealth of Oroites had come or had been carried up to Susa  it happened not long after  that king Dareios while engaged in hunting wild beasts twisted his foot in leaping off his horse  and it was twisted  as it seems  rather violently  for the ball of his ankle-joint was put out of the socket. Now he had been accustomed to keep about him those of the Egyptians who were accounted the first in the art of medicine  and he made use of their assistance then: but these by wrenching and forcing the foot made the evil continually greater. For seven days then and seven nights Dareios was sleepless owing to the pain which he suffered; and at last on the eighth day  when he was in a wretched state  some one who had heard talk before while yet at Sardis of the skill of Demokedes of Croton  reported this to Dareios; and he bade them bring him forthwith into his presence. So having found him somewhere unnoticed among the slaves of Oroites  they brought him forth into the midst dragging fetters after him and clothed in rags.,mashup

Accordingly upon that he spoke out  saying that he did not understand it precisely  but that he had kept company with a physician and had some poor knowledge of the art. Then after this  when Dareios had committed the case to him  by using Hellenic drugs and applying mild remedies after the former violent means  he caused him to get sleep  and in a short time made him perfectly well  though he had never hoped to be sound of foot again. Upon this Dareios presented him with two pairs of golden fetters; and he asked him whether it was by design that he had given to him a double share of his suffering  because he had made him well. Being pleased by this saying  Dareios sent him to visit his wives  and the eunuchs in bringing him in said to the women that this was he who had restored to the king his life. Then each one of them plunged a cup into the gold-chest and presented Demokedes with so abundant a gift that his servant  whose name was Skiton  following and gathering up the coins which fell from the cups  collected for himself a very large sum of gold.,mashup

This Demokedes came from Croton  and became the associate of Polycrates in the following manner:— at Croton he lived in strife with his father  who was of a harsh temper  and when he could no longer endure him  he departed and came to Egina. Being established there he surpassed in the first year all the other physicians  although he was without appliances and had none of the instruments which are used in the art. In the next year the Eginetan State engaged him for a payment of one talent  in the third year he was engaged by the Athenians for a hundred pounds weight of silver  and in the fourth by Polycrates for two talents. Thus he arrived in Samos; and it was by reason of this man more than anything else that the physicians of Croton got their reputation: for this event happened at the time when the physicians of Croton began to be spoken of as the first in Hellas  while the Kyrenians were reputed to have the second place.

Then Demokedes having healed king Dareios had a very great house in Susa  and had been made a table-companion of the king; and except the one thing of returning to the land of the Hellenes  he had everything. And first as regards the Egyptian physicians who tried to heal the king before him  when they were about to be impaled because they had proved inferior to a physician who was a Hellene  he asked their lives of the king and rescued them from death: then secondly  he rescued an Eleian prophet  who had accompanied Polycrates and had remained unnoticed among the slaves. In short Demokedes was very great in the favour of the king.,mashup

Not long time after this another thing came to pass which was this:— Atossa the daughter of Cyrus and wife of Dareios had a tumour upon her breast  which afterwards burst and then was spreading further: and so long as it was not large  she concealed it and said nothing to anybody  because she was ashamed; but afterwards when she was in evil case  she sent for Demokedes and showed it to him: and he said that he would make her well  and caused her to swear that she would surely do for him in return that which he should ask of her; and he would ask  he said  none of such things as are shameful.,mashup

Ταῦτα εἶπε καὶ ἅμα ἔπος τε καὶ ἔργον ἐποίεε. So when after this by his treatment he had made her well  then Atossa instructed by Demokedes uttered to Dareios in his bedchamber some such words as these:O king  though thou hast such great power  thou dost sit still  and dost not win in addition any nation or power for the Persians: and yet it is reasonable that a man who is both young and master of much wealth should be seen to perform some great deed  in order that the Persians may know surely that he is a man by whom they are ruled. It is expedient indeed in two ways that thou shouldest do so  both in order that the Persians may know that their ruler is a man  and in order that they may be worn down by war and not have leisure to plot against thee. For now thou mightest display some great deed  while thou art still young; seeing that as the body grows the spirit grows old also with it  and is blunted for every kind of action. Thus she spoke according to instructions received  and he answered thus:Woman  thou hast said all the things which I myself have in mind to do; for I have made the plan to yoke together a bridge from this continent to the other and to make expedition against the Scythians  and these designs will be by way of being fulfilled within a little time. Then Atossa said:Look now — forbear to go first against the Scythians  for these will be in thy power whenever thou desirest: but do thou  I pray thee  make an expedition against Hellas; for I am desirous to have Lacedemonian women and Argive and Athenian and Corinthian  for attendants  because I hear of them by report: and thou hast the man who of all men is most fitted to show thee all things which relate to Hellas and to be thy guide  that man  I mean  who healed thy foot. Dareios made answer:Woman  since it seems good to thee that we should first make trial of Hellas  I think it better to send first to them men of the Persians together with him of whom thou speakest  to make investigation  that when these have learnt and seen  they may report each several thing to us; and then I shall go to attack them with full knowledge of all.,mashup

Thus he said  and he proceeded to do the deed as he spoke the word: for as soon as day dawned  he summoned fifteen Persians  men of repute  and bade them pass through the coasts of Hellas in company with Demokedes  and take care not to let Demokedes escape from them  but bring him back at all costs. Having thus commanded them  next he summoned Demokedes himself and asked him to act as a guide for the whole of Hellas and show it to the Persians  and then return back: and he bade him take all his movable goods and carry them as gifts to his father and his brothers  saying that he would give him in their place many times as much; and besides this  he said  he would contribute to the gifts a merchant ship filled with all manner of goods  which should sail with him. Dareios  as it seems to me  promised him these things with no crafty design; but Demokedes was afraid that Dareios was making trial of him  and did not make haste to accept all that was offered  but said that he would leave his own things where they were  so that he might have them when he came back; he said however that he accepted the merchant ship which Dareios promised him for the presents to his brothers. Dareios then  having thus given command to him also  sent them away to the sea.,mashup

Then when they had made all things ready they set sail for Hellas  and touching at various places they saw the coast regions of it and wrote down a description  until at last  when they had seen the greater number of the famous places  they came to Taras in Italy. There from complaisance to Demokedes Aristophilides the king of the Tarentines unfastened and removed the steering-oars of the Median ships  and also confined the Persians in prison  because  as he alleged  they came as spies. While they were being thus dealt with  Demokedes went away and reached Croton; and when he had now reached his own native place  Aristophilides set the Persians free and gave back to them those parts of their ships which he had taken away.,mashup

The Persians then sailing thence and pursuing Demokedes reached Croton  and finding him in the market-place they laid hands upon him; and some of the men of Croton fearing the Persian power were willing to let him go  but others took hold of him and struck with their staves at the Persians  who pleaded for themselves in these words:Men of Croton  take care what ye are about: ye are rescuing a man who was a slave of king Dareios and who ran away from him. How  think you  will king Dareios be content to receive such an insult; and how shall this which ye do be well for you  if ye take him away from us? Against what city  think you  shall we make expedition sooner than against this  and what city before this shall we endeavour to reduce to slavery ? Thus saying they did not however persuade the men of Croton  but having had Demokedes rescued from them and the ship of burden which they were bringing with them taken away  they set sail to go back to Asia  and did not endeavour to visit any more parts of Hellas or to find out about them  being now deprived of their guide. This much however Demokedes gave them as a charge when they were putting forth to sea  bidding them say to Dareios that Demokedes was betrothed to the daughter of Milon: for the wrestler Milon had a great name at the king's court; and I suppose that Demokedes was urgent for this marriage  spending much money to further it  in order that Dareios might see that he was held in honour also in his own country.,mashup

The Persians however  after they had put out from Croton  were cast away with their ships in Iapygia; and as they were remaining there as slaves  Gillos a Tarentine exile rescued them and brought them back to king Dareios. In return for this Dareios offered to give him whatsoever thing he should desire; and Gillos chose that he might have the power of returning to Taras  narrating first the story of his misfortune: and in order that he might not disturb all Hellas  as would be the case if on his account a great armament should sail to invade Italy  he said it was enough for him that the men of Cnidos should be those who brought him back  without any others; because he supposed that by these  who were friends with the Tarentines  his return from exile would most easily be effected. Dareios accordingly having promised proceeded to perform; for he sent a message to Cnidos and bade them being back Gillos to Taras: and the men of Cnidos obeyed Dareios  but nevertheless they did not persuade the Tarentines  and they were not strong enough to apply force. Thus then it happened with regard to these things; and these were the first Persians who came from Asia to Hellas  and for the reason which has been mentioned these were sent as spies.,mashup

After this king Dareios took Samos before all other cities  whether of Hellenes or Barbarians  and for a cause which was as follows:— When Cambyses the son of Cyrus was marching upon Egypt  many Hellenes arrived in Egypt  some  as might be expected  joining in the campaign to make profit  and some also coming to see the land itself; and among these was Syoloson the son of Aiakes and brother of Polycrates  an exile from Samos. To this Syloson a fortunate chance occurred  which was this:— he had taken and put upon him a flame- coloured mantle  and was about the market-place in Memphis; and Dareios  who was then one of the spearmen of Cambyses and not yet held in any great estimation  seeing him had a desire for the mantle  and going up to him offered to buy it. Then Syloson  seeing that Dareios very greatly desired the mantle  by some divine inspiration said:I will not sell this for any sum  but I will give it thee for nothing  if  as it appears  it must be thine at all costs. To this Dareios agreed and received from him the garment.,mashup

Now Syloson supposed without any doubt that he had altogether lost this by easy simplicity; but when in course of time Cambyses was dead  and the seven Persians had risen up against the Magian  and of the seven Dareios had obtained the kingdom  Syloson heard that the kingdom had come about to that man to whom once in Egypt he had given the garment at his request: accordingly he went up to Susa and sat down at the entrance of the king's palace  and said that he was a benefactor of Dareios. The keeper of the door hearing this reported it to the king; and he marvelled at it and said to him:Who then of the Hellenes is my benefactor  to whom I am bound by gratitude? seeing that it is now but a short time that I possess the kingdom  and as yet scarcely one of them has come up to our court; and I may almost say that I have no debt owing to a Hellene. Nevertheless bring him in before me  that I may know what he means when he says these things. Then the keeper of the door brought Syloson before him  and when he had been set in the midst  the interpreters asked him who he was and what he had done  that he called himself the benefactor of the king. Syloson accordingly told all that had happened about the mantle  and how he was the man who had given it; to which Dareios made answer:O most noble of men  thou art he who when as yet I had no power gavest me a gift  small it may be  but nevertheless the kindness is counted with me to be as great as if I should now receive some great thing from some one. Therefore I will give thee in return gold and silver in abundance  that thou mayest not ever repent that thou didst render a service to Dareios the son of Hystaspes. To this Syloson replied:To me  O king  give neither gold nor silver  but recover and give to me my fatherland Samos  which now that my brother Polycrates has been slain by Oroites is possessed by our slave. This give to me without bloodshed or selling into slavery.,mashup

Now Maiandrios the son of Maiandrios was holding the rule over Samos  having received the government as a trust from Polycrates; and he  though desiring to show himself the most righteous of men  did not succeed in so doing: for when the death of Polycrates was reported to him  he did as follows:— first he founded an altar to Zeus the Liberator and marked out a sacred enclosure round it  namely that which exists still in the suburb of the city: then after he had done this he gathered together an assembly of all the citizens and spoke these words:To me  as ye know as well as I  has been entrusted the sceptre of Polycrates and all his power; and now it is open to me to be your ruler; but that for the doing of which I find fault with my neighbour  I will myself refrain from doing  so far as I may: for as I did not approve of Polycrates acting as master of men who were not inferior to himself  so neither do I approve of any other who does such things. Now Polycrates for his part fulfilled his own appointed destiny  and I now give the power into the hands of the people  and proclaim to you equality. These privileges however I think it right to have assigned to me  namely that from the wealth of Polycrates six talents should be taken out and given to me as a special gift; and in addition to this I choose for myself and for my descendants in succession the priesthood of Zeus the Liberator  to whom I myself founded a temple  while I bestow liberty upon you. He  as I say  made these offers to the Samians; but one of them rose up and said:Nay  but unworthy too art  thou  to be our ruler  seeing that thou art of mean birth and a pestilent fellow besides. Rather take care that thou give an account of the money which thou hadst to deal with.,mashup

These then had been put in bonds; but Maiandrios after this was overtaken by sickness  and his brother  whose name was Lycaretos  expecting that he would die  put all the prisoners to death  in order that he might himself more easily get possession of the power over Samos: and all this happened because  as it appears  they did not choose to be free.,mashup

So when the Persians arrived at Samos bringing Syloson home from exile  no one raised a hand against them  and moreover the party of Maiandrios and Maiandrios himself said that they were ready to retire out of the island under a truce. Otanes therefore having agreed on these terms and having made a treaty  the most honourable of the Persians had seats placed for them in front of the fortress and were sitting there.,mashup

This man for some offence which he had been committed had been confined in an underground dungeon  and at this time of which I speak  having heard what was being done and having put his head through out of the dungeon  when he saw the Persians peacefully sitting there he began to cry out and said that he desired to come to speech with Maiandrios. So Maiandrios hearing his voice bade them loose him and bring him into his presence; and as soon as he was brought he began to abuse and revile him  trying to persuade him to attack the Persians  and saying thus:Thou basest of men  didst thou put me in bonds and judge me worthy of the dungeon under ground  who am thine own brother and did no wrong worthy of bonds  and when thou seest the Persians casting thee forth from the land and making thee homeless  dost thou not dare to take any revenge  though they are so exceedingly easy to be overcome? Nay  but if in truth thou art afraid of them  give me thy mercenaries and I will take vengeance on them for their coming here; and thyself I am willing to let go out of the island.,mashup

Thus spoke Charilaos  and Maiandrios accepted that which he said  not  as I think  because he had reached such a height of folly as to suppose that his own power would overcome that of the king  but rather because he grudged Syloson that he should receive from him the State without trouble  and with no injury inflicted upon it. Therefore he desired to provoke the Persians to anger and make the Samian power as feeble as possible before he gave it up to him  being well assured that the Persians  when they had suffered evil  would be likely to be as bitter against the Samians as well as against those who did the wrong  and knowing also that he had a safe way of escape from the island whenever he desired: for he had had a secret passage made under ground  leading from the fortress to the sea. Maiandrios then himself sailed out from Samos; but Charilaos armed all the mercenaries  and opening wide the gates sent them out upon the Persians  who were not expecting any such thing  but supposed that all had been arranged: and the mercenaries falling upon them began to slay those of the Persians who had seats carried for them and were of most account. While these were thus engaged  the rest of the Persian force came to the rescue  and the mercenaries were hard pressed and forced to retire to the fortress.,mashup

Then Otanes the Persian commander  seeing that the Persians had suffered greatly  purposely forgot the commands which Dareios gave him when he sent him forth  not to kill any one of the Samians nor to sell any into slavery  but to restore the island to Syloson free from all suffering of calamity — these commands  I say  he purposely forgot  and gave the word to his army to slay every one whom they should take  man or boy  without distinction. So while some of the army were besieging the fortress  others were slaying every one who came in their way  in sanctuary or out of sanctuary equally.,mashup

Meanwhile Maiandrios had escaped from Samos and was sailing to Lacedemon; and having come thither and caused to be brought up to the city the things which he had taken with him when he departed  he did as follows:— first  he would set out his cups of silver and of gold  and then while the servants were cleaning them  he would be engaged in conversation with Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides  then king of Sparta  and would bring him on to his house; and when Cleomenes saw the cups he marvelled and was astonished at them  and Maiandrios would bid him take away with him as many of them as he pleased. Maiandrios said this twice or three times  but Cleomenes herein showed himself the most upright of men; for he not only did not think fit to take that which was offered  but perceiving that Maiandrios would make presents to others of the citizens  and so obtain assistance for himself  he went to the Ephors and said that it was better for Sparta that the stranger of Samos should depart from Peloponnesus  lest he might persuade either himself or some other man of the Spartans to act basely. They accordingly accepted his counsel  and expelled Maiandrios by proclamation.,mashup

After a naval force had thus gone against Samos  the Babylonians made revolt  being for this exceedingly well prepared; for during all the time of the reign of the Magian and of the insurrection of the seven  during all this time and the attendant confusion they were preparing themselves for the siege of their city: and it chanced by some means that they were not observed to be doing this. Then when they made open revolt  they did as follows:— after setting apart their mothers first  each man set apart also for himself one woman  whosoever he wished of his own household  and all the remainder they gathered together and killed by suffocation.

Dareios being informed of this and having gathered together all his power  made expedition against them  and when he had marched his army up to Babylon he began to besiege them; but they cared nothing about the siege  for the Babylonians used to go up to the battlements of the wall and show contempt of Dareios and of his army by gestures and by words; and one of them uttered this saying:Why  O Persians  do ye remain sitting here  and not depart? For then only shall ye capture us  when mules shall bring forth young. This was said by one of the Babylonians  not supposing that a mule would ever bring forth young.,mashup

And having regard to the words spoken by the Babylonian  who had said at first that when mules should produce young  then the wall would be taken  having regard (I say ) to this ominous saying  it seemed to Zopyros that Babylon could be taken: for he thought that both the man had spoken and his mule had produced young by divine dispensation.,mashup

Since then it seemed to him that it was now fated that Babylon should be captured  he went to Dareios and inquired of him whether he thought it a matter of very great moment to conquer Babylon; and hearing in answer that he thought it of great consequence  he considered again how he might be the man to take it and how the work might be his own: for among the Persians benefits are accounted worthy of a very high degree of honour. He considered accordingly that he was not able to make conquest of it by any other means  but only if he should maltreat himself and desert to their side. So  making light esteem of himself  he maltreated his own body in a manner which could not be cured; for he cut off his nose and his ears  and shaved his hair round in an unseemly way  and scourged himself  and so went into the presence of Dareios.,mashup

He replied:That man does not exist  excepting thee  who has so great power as to bring me into this condition; and not any stranger  O king  has done this  but I myself to myself  accounting it a very grievous thing that the Assyrians should make a mock of the Persians. He made answer:Thou most reckless of men  thou didst set the fairest name to the foulest deed when thou saidest that on account of those who are besieged thou didst bring thyself into a condition which cannot be cured. How  O thou senseless one  will the enemy surrender to us more quickly  because thou hast maltreated thyself? Surely thou didst wander out of thy senses in thus destroying thyself. And he said If I had communicated to thee that which I was about to do  thou wouldst not have permitted me to do it; but as it was  I did it on my own account. Now therefore  unless something is wanting on thy part  we shall conquer Babylon: for I shall go straightway as a deserter to the wall; and I shall say to them that I suffered this treatment at thy hands: and I think that when I have convinced them that this is so  I shall obtain the command of a part of their forces. Do thou then on the tenth day from that on which I shall enter within the wall take of those troops about which thou wilt have no concern if they be destroyed — of these  I say  get a thousand by the gate of the city which is called the gate of Semiramis; and after this again on the seventh day after the tenth set  I pray thee  two thousand by the gate which is called the gate of the Ninevites; and after this seventh day let twenty days elapse  and then lead other four thousand and place them by the gate called the gate of the Chaldeans: and let neither the former men nor these have any weapons to defend them except daggers  but this weapon let them have. Then after the twentieth day at once bid the rest of the army make an attack on the wall all round  and set the Persians  I pray thee  by those gates which are called the gate of Belos and the gate of Kissia: for  as I think  when I have displayed great deeds of prowess  the Babylonians will entrust to me  besides their other things  also the keys which draw the bolts of the gates. Then after that it shall be the care of myself and the Persians to do that which ought to be done.,mashup

Having thus enjoined he proceeded to go to the gate of the city  turning to look behind him as he went  as if he were in truth a deserter; and those who were set in that part of the wall  seeing him from the towers ran down  and slightly opening one wing of the gate asked who he was  and for what purpose he had come. And he addressed them and said that he was Zopyros  and that he came as a deserter to them. The gate-keepers accordingly when they heard this led him to the public assembly of the Babylonians; and being introduced before it he began to lament his fortunes  saying that he had in fact suffered at his own hands  and that he had suffered this because he had counselled the king to withdraw his army  since in truth there seemed to be no means of taking the town:And now  he went on to say I am come for very great good to you  O Babylonians  but for very great evil to Dareios and his army  and to the Persians  for he shall surely not escape with impunity for having thus maltreated me; and I know all the courses of his counsels.,mashup

Thus he spoke  and the Babylonians  when they saw the man of most reputation among the Persians deprived of nose and ears and smeared over with blood from scourging  supposing assuredly that he was speaking the truth and had come to be their helper  were ready to put in his power that for which he asked them  and he asked them that he might command a certain force. Then when he had obtained this from them  he did that which he had agreed with Dareios that he would do; for he led out on the tenth day the army of the Babylonians  and having surrounded the thousand men whom he had enjoined Dareios first to set there  he slew them. The Babylonians accordingly  perceiving that the deeds which he displayed were in accordance with his words  were very greatly rejoiced and were ready to serve him in all things: and after the lapse of the days which had been agreed upon  he again chose men of the Babylonians and led them out and slew the two thousand men of the troops of Dareios. Seeing this deed also  the Babylonians all had the name of Zopyros upon their tongues  and were loud in his praise. He then again  after the lapse of the days which had been agreed upon  led them out to the place appointed  and surrounded the four thousand and slew them. When this also had been done  Zopyros was everything among the Babylonians  and he was appointed both commander of their army and guardian of their walls.,mashup

But when Dareios made an attack according to the agreement on every side of the wall  then Zopyros discovered all his craft: for while the Babylonians  having gone up on the wall  were defending themselves against the attacks of the army of Dareios  Zopyros opened the gates called the gates of Kissia and of Belos  and let in the Persians within the wall. And of the Babylonians those who saw that which was done fled to the temple of Zeus Belos  but those who did not see remained each in his own appointed place  until at last they also learnt that they had been betrayed.,mashup

Thus was Babylon conquered for the second time: and Dareios when he had overcome the Babylonians  first took away the wall from round their city and pulled down all the gates; for when Cyrus took Babylon before him  he did neither of these things: and secondly Dareios impaled the leading men to the number of about three thousand  but to the rest of the Babylonians he gave back their city to dwell in: and to provide that the Babylonians should have wives  in order that their race might be propagated  Dareios did as follows (for their own wives  as has been declared at the beginning  the Babylonians had suffocated  in provident care for their store of food ):— he ordered the nations who dwelt round to bring women to Babylon  fixing a certain number for each nation  so that the sum total of fifty thousand women was brought together  and from these women the present Babylonians are descended.,mashup

As for Zopyros  in the judgment of Dareios no one of the Persians surpassed him in good service  either of those who came after or of those who had gone before  excepting Cyrus alone; for to Cyrus no man of the Persians ever yet ventured to compare himself: and Dareios is said to have declared often that he would rather that Zopyros were free from the injury than that he should have twenty Babylons added to his possession in addition to that one which he had. Moreover he gave him great honours; for not only did he give him every year those things which by the Persians are accounted the most honourable  but also he granted him Babylon to rule free from tribute  so long as he should live; and he added many other gifts. The son of this Zopyros was Megabyzos  who was made commander in Egypt against the Athenians and their allies; and the son of this Megabyzos was Zopyros  who went over to Athens as a deserter from the Persians.,mashup

After Babylon had been taken  the march of Dareios himself against the Scythians took place: for now that Asia was flourishing in respect of population  and large sums were being gathered in as revenue  Dareios formed the desire to take vengeance upon the Scythians  because they had first invaded the Median land and had overcome in fight those who opposed them; and thus they had been the beginners of wrong. The Scythians in truth  as I have before said  had ruled over Upper Asia for eight-and-twenty years; for they had invaded Asia in their pursuit of the Kimmerians  and they had deposed the Medes from their rule  who had rule over Asia before the Scythians came. Now when the Scythians had been absent from their own land for eight-and-twenty years  as they were returning to it after that interval of time  they were met by a contest not less severe than that which they had had with the Medes  since they found an army of no mean size opposing them. For the wives of the Scythians  because their husbands were absent from them for a long time  had associated with the slaves.,mashup

When they had drawn the milk they pour it into wooden vessels hollowed out  and they set the blind slaves in order about the vessels and agitate the milk. Then that which comes to the top they skim off  considering it the more valuable part  whereas they esteem that which settles down to be less good than the other. For this reason the Scythians put out the eyes of all whom they catch; for they are not tillers of the soil but nomads.,mashup

From these their slaves then  I say  and from their wives had been born and bred up a generation of young men  who having learnt the manner of their birth set themselves to oppose the Scythians as they were returning from the Medes. And first they cut off their land by digging a broad trench extending from the Tauric mountains to the Maiotian lake  at the point where this is broadest; then afterwards when the Scythians attempted to invade the land  they took up a position against them and fought; and as they fought many times  and the Scythians were not able to get any advantage in the fighting  one of them said:What a thing is this that we are doing  Scythians! We are fighting against our own slaves  and we are not only becoming fewer in number ourselves by being slain in battle  but also we are killing them  and so we shall have fewer to rule over in future. Now therefore to me it seems good that we leave spears and bows and that each one take his horse-whip and so go up close to them: for so long as they saw us with arms in our hands  they thought themselves equal to us and of equal birth; but when they shall see that we have whips instead of arms  they will perceive that they are our slaves  and having acknowledged this they will not await our onset.,mashup

Now the Scythians say that their nation is the youngest of all nations  and that this came to pass as follows:— The first man who ever existed in this region  which then was desert  was one named Targitaos: and of this Targitaos they say  though I do not believe it for my part  however they say the parents were Zeus and the daughter of the river Borysthenes. Targitaos  they report  was produced from some such origin as this  and of him were begotten three sons  Lipoxais and Arpoxais and the youngest Colaxais. In the reign of these there came down from heaven certain things wrought of gold  a plough  a yoke  a battle-axe  and a cup  and fell in the Scythian land: and first the eldest saw and came near them  desiring to take them  but the gold blazed with fire when he approached it: then when he had gone away from it  the second approached  and again it did the same thing. These then the gold repelled by blazing with fire; but when the third and youngest came up to it  the flame was quenched  and he carried them to his own house.

Thus the Scythians say they were produced; and from the time of their origin  that is to say from the first king Targitaos  to the passing over of Dareios against them  they say that there is a period of a thousand years and no more. Now this sacred gold is guarded by the kings with the utmost care  and they visit it every year with solemn sacrifices of propitiation: moreover if any one goes to sleep while watching in the open air over this gold during the festival  the Scythians say that he does not live out the year; and there is given him for this so much land as he shall ride round himself on his horse in one day. Now as the land was large  Colaxais  they say  established three kingdoms for his sons; and of these he made one larger than the rest  and in this the gold is kept. But as to the upper parts which lie on the North side of those who dwell above this land  they say one can neither see nor pass through any further by reason of feathers which are poured down; for both the earth and the air are full of feathers  and this is that which shuts off the view.,mashup

Thus say the Scythians about themselves and about the region above them; but the Hellenes who dwell about the Pontus say as follows:— Heracles driving the cattle of Geryones came to this land  then desert  which the Scythians now inhabit; and Geryones  says the tale  dwelt away from the region of the Pontus  living in the island called by the Hellenes Erytheia  near Gadeira which is outside the Pillars of Heracles by the Ocean.— As to the Ocean  they say indeed that it flows round the whole earth beginning from the place of the sunrising  but they do not prove this by facts.— From thence Heracles came to the land now called Scythia; and as a storm came upon him together with icy cold  he drew over him his lion's skin and went to sleep.

Then when Heracles woke he sought for them; and having gone over the whole land  at last he came to the region which is called Hylaia; and there he found in a cave a kind of twofold creature formed by the union of a maiden and a serpent  whose upper parts from the buttocks upwards were those of a woman  but her lower parts were those of a snake. Having seen her and marvelled at her  he asked her then whether she had seen any mares straying anywhere; and she said that she had them herself and would not give them up until he lay with her; and Heracles lay with her on condition of receiving them. She then tried to put off the giving back of the mares  desiring to have Heracles with her as long as possible  while he on the other hand desired to get the mares and depart; and at last she gave them back and said:These mares when they came hither I saved for thee  and thou didst give me reward for saving them; for I have by thee three sons. Tell me then  what must I do with these when they shall be grown to manhood  whether I shall settle them here  for over this land I have power alone  or send them away to thee ? She thus asked of him  and he  they say  replied:When thou seest that the boys are grown to men  do this and thou shalt not fail of doing right:— whichsoever of them thou seest able to stretch this bow as I do now  and to be girded with this girdle  him cause to be the settler of this land; but whosoever of them fails in the deeds which I enjoin  send him forth out of the land: and if thou shalt do thus  thou wilt both have delight thyself and perform that which has been enjoined to thee.,mashup

She then  when her sons had been born and had grown to be men  gave them names first  calling one of them Agathyrsos and the next Gelonos and the youngest Skythes; then bearing in mind the charge given to her  she did that which was enjoined. And two of her sons  Agathyrsos and Gelonos  not having proved themselves able to attain to the task set before them  departed from the land  being cast out by her who bore them; but Skythes the youngest of them performed the task and remained in the land: and from Skythes the son of Heracles were descended  they say  the succeeding kings of the Scythians (Skythians ): and they say moreover that it is by reason of the cup that the Scythians still even to this day wear cups attached to their girdles: and this alone his mother contrived for Skythes.

It is to the effect that the nomad Scythians dwelling in Asia  being hard pressed in war by the Massagetai  left their abode and crossing the river Araxes came towards the Kimmerian land (for the land which now is occupied by the Scythians is said to have been in former times the land of the Kimmerians ); and the Kimmerians  when the Scythians were coming against them  took counsel together  seeing that a great host was coming to fight against them; and it proved that their opinions were divided  both opinions being vehemently maintained  but the better being that of their kings: for the opinion of the people was that it was necessary to depart and that they ought not to run the risk of fighting against so many  but that of the kings was to fight for their land with those who came against them: and as neither the people were willing by means to agree to the counsel of the kings nor the kings to that of the people  the people planned to depart without fighting and to deliver up the land to the invaders  while the kings resolved to die and to be laid in their own land  and not to flee with the mass of the people  considering the many goods of fortune which they had enjoyed  and the many evils which it might be supposed would come upon them  if they fled from their native land. Having resolved upon this  they parted into two bodies  and making their numbers equal they fought with one another: and when these had all been killed by one another's hands  then the people of the Kimmerians buried them by the bank of the river Tyras (where their burial-place is still to be seen )  and having buried them  then they made their way out from the land  and the Scythians when they came upon it found the land deserted of its inhabitants.,mashup

And there are at the present time in the land of Scythia Kimmerian walls  and a Kimmerian ferry; and there is also a region which is called Kimmeria  and the so-called Kimmerian Bosphorus. It is known moreover that the Kimmerians  in their flight to Asia from the Scythians  also made a settlement on that peninsula on which now stands the Hellenic city of Sinope; and it is known too that the Scythians pursued them and invaded the land of Media  having missed their way; for while the Kimmerians kept ever along by the sea in their flight  the Scythians pursued them keeping Caucasus on their right hand  until at last they invaded Media  directing their course inland. This then which has been told is another story  and it is common both to Hellenes and Barbarians.,mashup

Aristeas however the son of Ca�strobios  a man of Proconnesos  said in the verses which he composed  that he came to the land of the Issedonians being possessed by Phoebus  and that beyond the Issedonians dwelt Arimaspians  a one-eyed race  and beyond these the gold-guarding griffins  and beyond them the Hyperboreans extending as far as the sea: and all these except the Hyperboreans  beginning with the Arimaspians  were continually making war on their neighbours  and the Issedonians were gradually driven out of their country by the Arimaspians and the Scythians by the Issedonians  and so the Kimmerians  who dwelt on the Southern Sea  being pressed by the Scythians left their land. Thus neither does he agree in regard to this land with the report of the Scythians.,mashup

As to Aristeas who composed this  I have said already whence he was; and I will tell also the tale which I heard about him in Proconnesos and Kyzicos. They say that Aristeas  who was in birth inferior to none of the citizens  entered into a fuller's shop in Proconnesos and there died; and the fuller closed his workshop and went away to report the matter to those who were related to the dead man. And when the news had been spread abroad about the city that Aristeas was dead  a man of Kyzicos who had come from the town of Artake entered into controversy with those who said so  and declared that he had met him going towards Kyzicos and had spoken with him: and while he was vehement in dispute  those who were related to the dead man came to the fuller's shop with the things proper in order to take up the corpse for burial; and when the house was opened  Aristeas was not found there either dead or alive. In the seventh year after this he appeared at Proconnesos and composed those verses which are now called by the Hellenes the  Arimaspeia  and having composed them he disappeared the second time.,mashup

So much is told by these cities; and what follows I know happened to the people of Metapontion in Italy two hundred and forty years after the second disappearance of Aristeas  as I found by putting together the evidence at Proconnesos and Metapontion. The people of Metapontion say that Aristeas himself appeared in their land and bade them set up an altar of Apollo and place by its side a statue bearing the name of Aristeas of Proconnesos; for he told them that to their land alone of all the Italiotes Apollo had come  and he  who now was Aristeas  was accompanying him  being then a raven when he accompanied the god. Having said this he disappeared; and the Metapontines say that they sent to Delphi and asked the god what the apparition of the man meant: and the Pythian prophetess bade them obey the command of the apparition  and told them that if they obeyed  it would be the better for them. They therefore accepted this answer and performed the commands; and there stands a statue now bearing the name of Aristeas close by the side of the altar dedicated to Apollo  and round it stand laurel trees; and the altar is set up in the market-place. Let this suffice which has been said about Aristeas.,mashup

Beginning with the trading station of the Borysthenites — for of the parts along the sea this is the central point of all Scythia — beginning with this  the first regions are occupied by the Callipidai  who are Hellenic Scythians; and above these is another race  who are called Alazonians. These last and the Callipidai in all other respects have the same customs as the Scythians  but they both sow corn and use it as food  and also onions  leeks  lentils and millet. Above the Alazonians dwell Scythians who till the ground  and these sow their corn not for food but to sell. Beyond them dwell the Neuroi; and beyond the Neuroi towards the North Wind is a region without inhabitants  as far as we know. These races are along the river Hypanis to the West of the Borysthenes;,mashup

These agricultural Scythians occupy the region which extends Eastwards for a distance of three days' journey  reaching to a river which is called Panticapes  and Northwards for a distance of eleven days' sail up the Borysthenes. Then immediately beyond these begins the desert and extends for a great distance; and on the other side of the desert dwell the Androphagoi  a race apart by themselves and having no connection with the Scythians. Beyond them begins a region which is really desert and has no race of men in it  as far as we know.,mashup

These reach Southwards to the Tauric land  and Eastwards to the trench which those who were begotten of the blind slaves dug  and to the trading station which is called Cremnoi upon the Maiotian lake; and some parts of their country reach to the river Tanais. Beyond the Royal Scythians towards the North Wind dwell the Melanchlainoi  of a different race and not Scythian.

Then beyond the Budinoi towards the North  first there is desert for seven days' journey; and after the desert turning aside somewhat more towards the East Wind we come to land occupied by the Thyssagetai  a numerous people and of separate race from the others. These live by hunting; and bordering upon them there are settled also in these same regions men who are called Irycai  who also live by hunting  which they practise in the following manner:— the hunter climbs up a tree and lies in wait there for his game (now trees are abundant in all this country )  and each has a horse at hand  which has been taught to lie down upon its belly in order that it may make itself low  and also a dog: and when he sees the wild animal from the tree  he first shoots his arrow and then mounts upon his horse and pursues it  and the dog seizes hold of it. Above these in a direction towards the East dwell other Scythians  who have revolted from the Royal Scythians and so have come to this region.,mashup

Then when one has passed through a great extent of this rugged country  there dwell in the skirts of lofty mountains men who are said to be all bald-headed from their birth  male and female equally  and who have flat noses and large chins and speak a language of their own  using the Scythian manner of dress  and living on the produce of trees. The tree on the fruit of which they live is called the Pontic tree  and it is about the size of a fig- tree: this bears a fruit the size of a bean  containing a stone. When the fruit has ripened  they strain it through cloths and there flows from it a thick black juice  and this juice which flows from it is called /as-chy/. This they either lick up or drink mixed with milk  and from its lees  that is the solid part  they make cakes and use them for food; for they have not many cattle  since the pastures there are by no means good. Each man has his dwelling under a tree  in winter covering the tree all round with close white felt-cloth  and in summer without it. These are injured by no men  for they are said to be sacred  and they possess no weapon of war. These are they also who decide the disputes rising among their neighbours; and besides this  whatever fugitive takes refuge with them is injured by no one: and they are called Argippaians.,mashup

Now as far as these bald-headed men there is abundantly clear information about the land and about the nations on this side of them; for not only do certain of the Scythians go to them  from whom it is not difficult to get information  but also some of the Hellenes who are at the trading-station of the Borysthenes and the other trading- places of the Pontic coast: and those of the Scythians who go to them transact their business through seven interpreters and in seven different languages.,mashup

So far as these  I say  the land is known; but concerning the region to the North of the bald-headed men no one can speak with certainty  for lofty and impassable mountains divide it off  and no one passes over them. However these bald-headed men say (though I do not believe it ) that the mountains are inhabited by men with goats' feet; and that after one has passed beyond these  others are found who sleep through six months of the year. This I do not admit at all as true. However  the country to the East of the bald-headed men is known with certainty  being inhabited by the Issedonians  but that which lies beyond both the bald-headed men and the Issedonians towards the North Wind is unknown  except so far as we know it from the accounts given by these nations which have just been mentioned.,mashup

The Issedonians are said to have these customs:— when a man's father is dead  all the relations bring cattle to the house  and then having slain them and cut up the flesh  they cut up also the dead body of the father of their entertainer  and mixing all the flesh together they set forth a banquet. His skull however they strip of the flesh and clean it out and then gild it over  and after that they deal with it as a sacred thing and perform for the dead man great sacrifices every year. This each son does for his father  just as the Hellenes keep the day of memorial for the dead. In other respects however this race also is said to live righteously  and their women have equal rights with the men.,mashup

This whole land which has been described is so exceedingly severe in climate  that for eight months of the year there is frost so hard as to be intolerable; and during these if you pour out water you will not be able to make mud  but only if you kindle a fire can you make it; and the sea is frozen and the whole of the Kimmerian Bosphorus  so that the Scythians who are settled within the trench make expeditions and drive their waggons over into the country of the Sindians. Thus it continues to be winter for eight months  and even for the remaining four it is cold in those parts. This winter is distinguished in its character from all the winters which come in other parts of the world; for in it there is no rain to speak of at the usual season for rain  whereas in summer it rains continually; and thunder does not come at the time when it comes in other countries  but is very frequent  in the summer; and if thunder comes in winter  it is marvelled at as a prodigy: just so  if an earthquake happens  whether in summer or in winter  it is accounted a prodigy in Scythia. Horses are able to endure this winter  but neither mules nor asses can endure it at all  whereas in other countries horses if they stand in frost lose their limbs by mortification  while asses and mules endure it.,mashup

The Eleians themselves say that in consequence of some curse mules are not begotten in their land; but when the time approaches for the mares to conceive  they drive them out into the neighbouring lands and there in the land of their neighbours they admit to them the he-asses until the mares are pregnant  and then they drive them back.,mashup

Now whomsoever has seen close at hand snow falling thickly  knows what I mean without further explanation  for the snow is like feathers: and on account of this wintry weather  being such as I have said  the Northern parts of this continent are uninhabitable.

About a Hyperborean people the Scythians report nothing  nor do any of those who dwell in this region  unless it be the Issedonians: but in my opinion neither do these report anything; for if they did the Scythians also would report it  as they do about the one-eyed people. Hesiod however has spoken of Hyperboreans  and so also has Homer in the poem of theEpigonoi  at least if Homer was really the composer of that Epic.,mashup

But much more about them is reported by the people of Delos than by any others. For these say that sacred offerings bound up in wheat straw are carried from the land of the Hyperboreans and come to the Scythians  and then from the Scythians the neighbouring nations in succession receive them and convey them Westwards  finally as far as the Adriatic: thence they are sent forward towards the South  and the people of Dodona receive them first of all the Hellenes  and from these they come down to the Malian gulf and are passed over to Euboea  where city sends them on to city till they come to Carystos. After this Andros is left out  for the Carystians are those who bring them to Tenos  and the Tenians to Delos. Thus they say that these sacred offerings come to Delos; but at first  they say  the Hyperboreans sent two maidens bearing the sacred offerings  whose names  say the Delians  were Hyperoche and Laodike  and with them for their protection the Hyperboreans sent five men of their nation to attend them  those namely who are now called /Perphereës/ and have great honours paid to them in Delos. Since however the Hyperboreans found that those who were sent away did not return back  they were troubled to think that it would always befall them to send out and not to receive back; and so they bore the offerings to the borders of their land bound up in wheat straw  and laid a charge upon their neighbours  bidding them send these forward from themselves to another nation. These things then  they say  come to Delos being thus sent forward; and I know of my own knowledge that a thing is done which has resemblance to these offerings  namely that the women of Thrace and Paionia  when they sacrifice to Artemisthe Queen  do not make their offerings without wheat straw.,mashup

The maidens  I say  have this honour paid them by the dwellers in Delos: and the same people say that Arge and Opis also  being maidens  came to Delos  passing from the Hyperboreans by the same nations which have been mentioned  even before Hyperoche and Laodike. These last  they say  came bearing for Eileithuia the tribute which they had laid upon themselves for the speedy birth  but Arge and Opis came with the divinities themselves  and other honours have been assigned to them by the people of Delos: for the women  they say  collect for them  naming them by their names in the hymn which Olen a man of Lykia composed in their honour; and both the natives of the other islands and the Ionians have learnt from them to sing hymns naming Opis and Arge and collecting:— now this Olen came from Lukia and composed also the other ancient hymns which are sung in Delos:— and moreover they say that when the thighs of the victim are consumed upon the altar  the ashes of them are used to cast upon the grave of Opis and Arge. Now their grave is behind the temple of Artemis  turned towards the East  close to the banqueting hall of the Keieans.,mashup

I wonder then at those who have parted off and divided the world into Libya  Asia  and Europe  since the difference between these is not small; for in length Europe extends along by both  while in breadth it is clear to me that it is beyond comparison larger; for Libya furnishes proofs about itself that it is surrounded by sea  except so much of it as borders upon Asia; and this fact was shown by Necos king of the Egyptians first of all those about whom we have knowledge. He when he had ceased digging the channel which goes through from the Nile to the Arabian gulf  sent Phenicians with ships  bidding them sail and come back through the Pillars of Heracles to the Northern Sea and so to Egypt. The Phenicians therefore set forth from the Erythraian Sea and sailed through the Southern Sea; and when autumn came  they would put to shore and sow the land  wherever in Libya they might happen to be as they sailed  and then they waited for the harvest: and having reaped the corn they would sail on  so that after two years had elapsed  in the third year they turned through the Pillars of Heracles and arrived again in Egypt. And they reported a thing which I cannot believe  but another man may  namely that in sailing round Libya they had the sun on their right hand.,mashup

Thus was this country first known to be what it is  and after this it is the Carthaginians who make report of it; for as to Sataspes the son of Teaspis the Achaimenid  he did not sail round Libya  though he was sent for this very purpose  but was struck with fear by the length of the voyage and the desolate nature of the land  and so returned back and did not accomplish the task which his mother laid upon him. For this man had outraged a daughter of Zopyros the son of Megabyzos  a virgin; and then when he was about to be impaled by order of king Xerxes for this offence  the mother of Sataspes  who was a sister of Dareios  entreated for his life  saying that she would herself lay upon him a greater penalty than Xerxes; for he should be compelled (she said ) to sail round Libya  until in sailing round it he came to the Arabian gulf. So then Xerxes having agreed upon these terms  Sataspes went to Egypt  and obtaining a ship and sailors from the Egyptians  he sailed to the Pillars of Heracles; and having sailed through them and turned the point of Libya which is called the promontory of Soloeis  he sailed on towards the South. Then after he had passed over much sea in many months  as there was needed ever more and more voyaging  he turned about and sailed back again to Egypt: and having come from thence into the presence of king Xerxes  he reported saying that at the furthest point which he reached he was sailing by dwarfish people  who used clothing made from the palm-tree  and who  whenever they came to land with their ship  left their towns and fled away to the mountains: and they  he said  did no injury when they entered into the towns  but took food from them only. And the cause  he said  why he had not completely sailed round Libya was that the ship could not advance any further but stuck fast. Xerxes however did not believe that he was speaking the truth  and since he had not performed the appointed task  he impaled him  inflicting upon him the penalty pronounced before. A eunuch belonging to this Sataspes ran away to Samos as soon as he heard that his master was dead  carrying with him large sums of money; and of this a man of Samos took possession  whose name I know  but I purposely pass it over without mention.,mashup

Of Asia the greater part was explored by Dareios  who desiring to know of the river Indus  which is a second river producing crocodiles of all the rivers in the world — to know  I say  of this river where it runs out into the sea  sent with ships  besides others whom he trusted to speak the truth  Skylax also  a man of Caryanda. These starting from the city of Caspatyros and the land of Pactyike  sailed down the river towards the East and the sunrising to the sea; and then sailing over the sea Westwards they came in the thirtieth month to that place from whence the king of the Egyptians had sent out the Phenicians of whom I spoke before  to sail round Libya. After these had made their voyage round the coast  Dareios both subdued the Indians and made use of this sea. Thus Asia also  excepting the parts of it which are towards the rising sun  has been found to be similar to Libya.,mashup

As to Europe  however  it is clearly not known by any  either as regards the parts which are towards the rising sun or those towards the North  whether it be surrounded by sea: but in length it is known to stretch along by both the other divisions. And I am not able to understand for what reason it is that to the Earth  which is one  three different names are given derived from women  and why there were set as boundaries to divide it the river Nile of Egypt and the Phasis in Colchis (or as some say the Maiotian river Tanais and the Kimmerian ferry ); nor can I learn who those persons were who made the boundaries  or for what reason they gave the names. Libya indeed is said by most of the Hellenes to have its name from Libya a woman of that country  and Asia from the wife of Prometheus: but this last name is claimed by the Lydians  who say that Asia has been called after Asias the son of Cotys the son of Manes  and not from Asia the wife of Prometheus; and from him too they say the Asian tribe in Sardis has its name. As to Europe however  it is neither known by any man whether it is surrounded by sea  nor does it appear whence it got this name or who he was who gave it  unless we shall say that the land received its name from Europa the Tyrian; and if so  it would appear that before this it was nameless like the rest. She however evidently belongs to Asia and did not come to this land which is now called by the Hellenes Europe  but only from Phenicia to Crete  and from Crete to Lykia. Let this suffice now which has been said about these matters; for we will adopt those which are commonly accepted of the accounts.,mashup

These are the native Scythian rivers which join to swell its stream  while from the Agathyrsians flows the Maris and joins the Ister  and from the summits of Haimos flow three other great rivers towards the North Wind and fall into it  namely Atlas and Auras and Tibisis. Through Thrace and the Thracian Crobyzians flow the rivers Athrys and Noes and Artanes  running into the Ister; and from the Paionians and Mount Rhodope the river Kios  cutting through Haimos in the midst  runs into it also. From the Illyrians the river Angros flows Northwards and runs out into the Triballian plain and into the river Brongos  and the Brongos flows into the Ister; thus the Ister receives both these  being great rivers. From the region which is above the Ombricans  the river Carpis and another river  the Alpis  flow also towards the North Wind and run into it; for the Ister flows in fact through the whole of Europe  beginning in the land of the Keltoi  who after the Kynesians dwell furthest towards the sun- setting of all the peoples of Europe; and thus flowing through all Europe it falls into the sea by the side of Scythia.,mashup

And the Ister flows at an equal level always both in summer and in winter for some such cause as this  as I suppose:— in winter it is of the natural size  or becomes only a little larger than its nature  seeing that this land receives very little rain in winter  but constantly has snow; whereas in summer the snow which fell in the winter  in quantity abundant  melts and runs from all parts into the Ister. This snow of which I speak  running into the river helps to swell its volume  and with it also many and violent showers of rain  for it rains during the summer: and thus the waters which mingle with the Ister are more copious in summer than they are in winter by about as much as the water which the Sun draws to himself in summer exceeds that which he draws in winter; and by the setting of these things against one another there is produced a balance; so that the river is seen to be of equal volume always.,mashup

The third river is the Hypanis  which starts from Scythia and flows from a great lake round which feed white wild horses; and this lake is rightly calledMother of Hypanis. From this then the river Hypanis takes its rise and for a distance of five days' sail it flows shallow and with sweet water still; but from this point on towards the sea for four days' sail it is very bitter  for there flows into it the water of a bitter spring  which is so exceedingly bitter that  small as it is  it changes the water of the Hypanis by mingling with it  though that is a river to which few are equal in greatness. This spring is on the border between the lands of the agricultural Scythians and of the Alazonians  and the name of the spring and of the place from which it flows is in Scythian Exampaios  and in the Hellenic tongue Hierai Hodoi. Now the Tyras and the Hypanis approach one another in their windings in the land of the Alazonians  but after this each turns off and widens the space between them as they flow.,mashup

Fourth is the river Borysthenes  which is both the largest of these after the Ister  and also in our opinion the most serviceable not only of the Scythian rivers but also of all the rivers of the world besides  excepting only the Nile of Egypt  for to this it is not possible to compare any other river: of the rest however the Borysthenes is the most serviceable  seeing that it provides both pastures which are the fairest and the richest for cattle  and fish which are better by far and more numerous than those of any other river  and also it is the sweetest water to drink  and flows with clear stream  though others beside it are turbid  and along its banks crops are produced better than elsewhere  while in parts where it is not sown  grass grows deeper. Moreover at its mouth salt forms of itself in abundance  and it produces also huge fish without spines  which they call  antacaioi  to be used for salting  and many other things also worthy of wonder. Now as far as the region of the Gerrians  to which it is a voyage of forty days  the Borysthenes is known as flowing from the North Wind; but above this none can tell through what nations it flows: it is certain however that it runs through desert to the land of the agricultural Scythians; for these Scythians dwell along its banks for a distance of ten days' sail. Of this river alone and of the Nile I cannot tell where the sources are  nor  I think  can any of the Hellenes. When the Borysthenes comes near the sea in its course  the Hypanis mingles with it  running out into the same marsh; and the space between these two rivers  which is as it were a beak of land  is called the point of Hippoles  and in it is placed a temple of the Mother  and opposite the temple upon the river Hypanis are settled the Borysthenites.,mashup

The gods whom they propitiate by worship are these only:— Hestia most of all  then Zeus and the Earth  supposing that Earth is the wife of Zeus  and after these Apollo  and Aphrodite Urania  and Heracles  and Ares. Of these all the Scythians have the worship established  and the so-called Royal Scythians sacrifice also to Poseidon. Now Hestia is called in Scythian Tabiti  and Zeus  being most rightly named in my opinion  is called Papaios  and Earth Api  and Apollo Oitosyros  and Aphrodite Urania is called Argimpasa  and Poseidon Thagimasidas. It is not their custom however to make images  altars or temples to any except Ares  but to him it is their custom to make them.,mashup

Now as the land of Scythia is exceedingly ill wooded  this contrivance has been invented for the boiling of the flesh:— having flayed the victims  they strip the flesh off the bones and then put it into caldrons  if they happen to have any  of native make  which very much resemble Lesbian mixing-bowls except that they are much larger — into these they put the flesh and boil it by lighting under it the bones of the victim: if however thy have not at hand the caldron  they put all the flesh into the stomachs of the victims and adding water they light the bones under them; and these blaze up beautifully  and the stomachs easily hold the flesh when it has been stripped off the bones: thus an ox is made to boil itself  and the other kinds of victims each boil themselves also. Then when the flesh is boiled  the sacrificer takes a first offering of the flesh and of the vital organs and casts it in front of him. And they sacrifice various kinds of cattle  but especially horses.,mashup

To the others of the gods they sacrifice thus and these kinds of beasts  but to Ares as follows:— In each district of the several governments they have a temple of Ares set up in this way:— bundles of brushwood are heaped up for about three furlongs in length and in breadth  but less in height; and on the top of this there is a level square made  and three of the sides rise sheer but by the remaining one side the pile may be ascended. Every year they pile on a hundred and fifty waggon-loads of brushwood  for it is constantly settling down by reason of the weather. Upon this pile of which I speak each people has an ancient iron sword set up  and this is the sacred symbol of Ares. To this sword they bring yearly offerings of cattle and of horses; and they have the following sacrifice in addition  beyond what they make to the other gods  that is to say  of all the enemies whom they take captive in war they sacrifice one man in every hundred  not in the same manner as they sacrifice cattle  but in a different manner: for they first pour wine over their heads  and after that they cut the throats of the men  so that the blood runs into a bowl; and then they carry this up to the top of the pile of brushwood and pour the blood over the sword. This  I say  they carry up; and meanwhile below by the side of the temple they are doing thus:— they cut off all the right arms of the slaughtered men with the hands and throw them up into the air  and then when they have finished offering the other victims  they go away; and the arm lies wheresoever it has chanced to fall  and the corpse apart from it.,mashup

That which relates to war is thus ordered with them:— When a Scythian has slain his first man  he drinks some of his blood: and of all those whom he slays in the battle he bears the heads to the king; for if he has brought a head he shares in the spoil which they have taken  but otherwise not. And he takes off the skin of the head by cutting it round about the ears and then taking hold of the scalp and shaking it off; afterwards he scrapes off the flesh with the rib of an ox  and works the skin about with his hands; and when he has thus tempered it  he keeps it as a napkin to wipe the hands upon  and hangs it from the bridle of the horse on which he himself rides  and takes pride in it; for whosoever has the greatest number of skins to wipe the hands upon  he is judged to be the bravest man. Many also make cloaks to wear of the skins stripped off  sewing them together like shepherds' cloaks of skins; and many take the skin together with the finger-nails off the right hands of their enemies when they are dead  and make them into covers for their quivers: now human skin it seems is both thick and glossy in appearance  more brilliantly white than any other skin. Many also take the skins off the whole bodies of men and stretch them on pieces of wood and carry them about on their horses.,mashup

Such are their established customs about these things; and to the skulls themselves  not of all but of their greatest enemies  they do thus:— the man saws off all below the eyebrows and clears out the inside; and if he is a poor man he only stretches ox-hide round it and then makes use of it; but if he be rich  besides stretching the ox-hide he gilds it over within  and makes use of it as a drinking- cup. They do this also if any of their own family have been at variance with them and the man gets the better of his adversary in trial before the king; and when strangers come to him whom he highly esteems  he sets these skulls before them  and adds the comment that they being of his own family had made war against him  and that he had got the better of them; and this they hold to be a proof of manly virtue.,mashup

Diviners there are many among the Scythians  and they divine with a number of willow rods in the following manner:— they bring large bundles of rods  and having laid them on the ground they unroll them  and setting each rod by itself apart they prophesy; and while speaking thus  they roll the rods together again  and after that they place them in order a second time one by one. This manner of divination they have from their fathers: but the  Enareis  orman-women say that Aphrodite gave them the gift of divination  and they divine accordingly with the bark of the linden-tree. Having divided the linden-bark into three strips  the man twists them together in his fingers and untwists them again  and as he does this he utters the oracle.,mashup

He then who they say has sworn falsely  is brought forthwith held fast on both sides; and when he has come the diviners charge him with this  that he is shown by their divination to have sworn falsely by the hearth of the king  and that for this reason the king is suffering pain: and he denies and says that he did not swear falsely  and complains indignantly: and when he denies it  the king sends for other diviners twice as many in number  and if these also by looking into their divination pronounce him guilty of having sworn falsely  at once they cut off the man's head  and the diviners who came first part his goods among them by lot; but if the diviners who came in afterwards acquit him  other diviners come in  and again others after them.

The burial-place of the kings is in the land of the Gerrians  the place up to which the Borysthenes is navigable. In this place  when their king has died  they make a large square excavation in the earth; and when they have made this ready  they take up the corpse (the body being covered over with wax and the belly ripped up and cleansed  and then sewn together again  after it has been filled with  kyperos  cut up and spices and parsley-seed and anise )  and they convey it in a waggon to another nation. Then those who receive the corpse thus conveyed to them do the same as the Royal Scythians  that is they cut off a part of their ear and shave their hair round about and cut themselves all over the arms and tear their forehead and nose and pass arrows through their left hand. Thence they convey in the waggon the corpse of the king to another of the nations over whom they rule; and they to whom they came before accompany them: and when they have gone round to all conveying the corpse  then they are in the land of the Gerrians  who have their settlements furthest away of all the nations over whom they rule  and they have reached the spot where the burial place is. After that  having placed the corpse in the tomb upon a bed of leaves  they stick spears along on this side and that of the corpse and stretch pieces of wood over them  and then they cover the place in with matting. Then they strangle and bury in the remaining space of the tomb one of the king's mistresses  his cup-bearer  his cook  his horse-keeper  his attendant  and his bearer of messages  and also horses  and a first portion of all things else  and cups of gold; for silver they do not use at all  nor yet bronze. Having thus done they all join together to pile up a great mound  vying with one another and zealously endeavouring to make it as large as possible.,mashup

Afterwards  when the year comes round again  they do as follows:— they take the most capable of the remaining servants — and these are native Scythians  for those serve him whom the king himself commands to do so  and his servants are not bought for money — of these attendants then they strangle fifty and also fifty of the finest horses; and when they have taken out their bowels and cleansed the belly  they fill it with chaff and sew it together again. Then they set the half of a wheel upon two stakes with the hollow side upwards  and the other half of the wheel upon other two stakes  and in this manner they fix a number of these; and after this they run thick stakes through the length of the horses as far as the necks  and they mount them upon the wheels; and the front pieces of wheel support the shoulders of the horses  while those behind bear up their bellies  going by the side of the thighs; and both front and hind legs hang in the air. On the horses they put bridles and bits  and stretch the bridles tight in front of them and then tie them up to pegs: and of the fifty young men who have been strangled they mount each one upon his horse  having first run a straight stake through each body along by the spine up to the neck; and a part of this stake projects below  which they fasten into a socket made in the other stake that runs through the horse. Having set horsemen such as I have described in a circle round the tomb  they then ride away.,mashup

Thus they bury their kings; but as for the other Scythians  when they die their nearest relations carry them round laid in waggons to their friends in succession; and of them each one when he receives the body entertains those who accompany it  and before the corpse they serve up of all things about the same quantity as before the others. Thus private persons are carried about for forty days  and then they are buried: and after burying them the Scythians cleanse themselves in the following way:— they soap their heads and wash them well  and then  for their body  they set up three stakes leaning towards one another and about them they stretch woollen felt coverings  and when they have closed them as much as possible they throw stones heated red-hot into a basin placed in the middle of the stakes and the felt coverings.,mashup

The Scythians then take the seed of this hemp and creep under the felt coverings  and then they throw the seed upon the stones which have been heated red-hot: and it burns like incense and produces a vapour so think that no vapour-bath in Hellas would surpass it: and the Scythians being delighted with the vapour-bath howl like wolves. This is to them instead of washing  for in fact they do not wash their bodies at all in water. Their women however pound with a rough stone the wood of the cypress and cedar and frankincense tree  pouring in water with it  and then with this pounded stuff  which is thick  they plaster over all their body and also their face; and not only does a sweet smell attach to them by reason of this  but also when they take off the plaster on the next day  their skin is clean and shining.,mashup

This nation also is very averse to adopting strange customs  rejecting even those of other tribes among themselves  but especially those of the Hellenes  as the history of Anacharsis and also afterwards of Skyles proved. For as to Anacharsis first  when he was returning to the abodes of the Scythians  after having visited many lands and displayed in them much wisdom  as he sailed through the Hellespont he put in to Kyzicos: and since he found the people of Kyzicos celebrating a festival very magnificently in honour of the Mother of the gods  Anacharsis vowed to the Mother that if he should return safe and sound to his own land  he would both sacrifice to her with the same rites as he saw the men of Kyzicos do  and also hold a night festival. So when he came to Scythia he went down into the region called Hylaia (this is along by the side of the racecourse of Achilles and is quite full  as it happens  of trees of all kinds ) — into this  I say  Anacharsis went down  and proceeded to perform all the ceremonies of the festival in honour of the goddess  with a kettle-drum and with images hung about himself. And one of the Scythians perceived him doing this and declared it to Saulios the king; and the king came himself also  and when he saw Anacharsis doing this  he shot him with an arrow and killed him. Accordingly at the present time if one asks about Anacharsis  the Scythians say that they do not know him  and for this reason  because he went out of his own country to Hellas and adopted foreign customs. And as I heard from Tymnes the steward of Ariapeithes  he was the uncle on the father's side of Idanthyrsos king of the Scythians  and the son of Gnuros  the son of Lycos  the son of Spargapeithes. If then Anacharsis was of this house  let him know that he died by the hand of his brother  for Idanthyrsos was the son of Saulios  and Saulios was he who killed Anacharsis.,mashup

This man then fared thus badly by reason of foreign customs and communication with Hellenes; and very many years afterwards Skyles the son of Ariapeithes suffered nearly the same fate as he. For Ariapeithes the king of the Scythians with other sons had Skyles born to him: and he was born of a woman who was of Istria  and certainly not a native of Scythia; and this mother taught him the language and letters of Hellas. Afterwards in course of time Ariapeithes was brought to his end by treachery at the hands of Spargapeithes the king of the Agathyrsians  and Skyles succeeded to the kingdom; and he took not only that but also the wife of his father  whose name was Opoia: this Opoia was a native Scythian and from her was born Oricos to Ariapeithes. Now when Skyles was king of the Scythians  he was by no means satisfied with the Scythian manner of life  but was much more inclined towards Hellenic ways because of the training with which he had been brought up  and he used to do somewhat as follows:— When he came with the Scythians in arms to the city of the Borysthenites (now these Borysthenites say that they are of Miletos ) — when Skyles came to these  he would leave his band in the suburbs of the city and go himself within the walls and close the gates. After that he would lay aside his Scythian equipments and take Hellenic garments  and wearing them he would go about in the market-place with no guards or any other man accompanying him (and they watched the gates meanwhile  that none of the Scythians might see him wearing this dress ): and while in other respects too he adopted Hellenic manners of life  he used also to perform worship to the gods according to the customs of the Hellenes. Then having stayed a month or more than that  he would put on the Scythian dress and depart. This he did many times  and he both built for himself a house in Borysthenes and also took to it a woman of the place as his wife.,mashup

Since however it was fated that evil should happen to him  it happened by an occasion of this kind:— he formed a desire to be initiated in the rites of Bacchus-Dionysos  and as he was just about to receive the initiation  there happened a very great portent. He had in the city of the Borysthenites a house of great size and built with large expense  of which also I made mention a little before this  and round it were placed sphinxes and griffins of white stone: on this house Zeus caused a bolt to fall; and the house was altogether burnt down  but Skyles none the less for this completed his initiation. Now the Scythians make the rites of Bacchus a reproach against the Hellenes  for they say that it is not fitting to invent a god like this  who impels men to frenzy. So when Skyles had been initiated into the rites of Bacchus  one of the Borysthenites went off to the Scythians and said:Whereas ye laugh at us  O Scythians  because we perform the rite of Bacchus and because the god seizes us  now this divinity has seized also your king; and he is both joining in the rite of Bacchus and maddened by the influence of the god. And if ye disbelieve me  follow and I will show you. The chief men of the Scythians followed him  and the Borysthenite led them secretly into the town and set them upon a tower. So when Skyles passed by with the company of revellers  and the Scythians saw him joining in the rite of Bacchus  they were exceedingly grieved at it  and they went out and declared to the whole band that which they had seen.,mashup

After this when Skyles was riding out again to his own abode  the Scythians took his brother Octamasades for their leader  who was a son of the daughter of Teres  and made insurrection against Skyles. He then when he perceived that which was being done to his hurt and for what reason it was being done  fled for refuge to Thrace; and Octamasades being informed of this  proceeded to march upon Thrace. So when he had arrived at the river Ister  the Thracians met him; and as they were about to engage battle  Sitalkes sent a messenger to Octamasades and said:Why must we make trial of one another in fight? Thou art my sister's son and thou hast in thy power my brother. Do thou give him back to me  and I will deliver to thee thy brother Skyles: and let us not either of us set our armies in peril  either thou or I. Thus Sitalkes proposed to him by a herald; for there was with Octamasades a brother of Sitalkes  who had gone into exile for fear of him. And Octamasades agreed to this  and by giving up his own mother's brother to Sitalkes he received his brother Skyles in exchange: and Sitalkes when he received his brother led him away as a prisoner  but Octamasades cut off the head of Skyles there upon the spot. Thus do the Scythians carefully guard their own customary observances  and such are the penalties which they inflict upon those who acquire foreign customs besides their own.,mashup

How many the Scythians are I was not able to ascertain precisely  but I heard various reports of the number: for reports say both that they are very many in number and also that they are few  at least as regards the true Scythians. Thus far however they gave me evidence of my own eyesight:— there is between the river Borysthenes and the Hypanis a place called Exampaios  of which also I made mention somewhat before this  saying that there was in it a spring of bitter water  from which the water flows and makes the river Hypanis unfit to drink. In this place there is set a bronze bowl  in size at least six times as large as the mixing-bowl at the entrance of the Pontus  which Pausanias the son of Cleombrotos dedicated: and for him who has never seen that  I will make the matter clear by saying that the bowl in Scythia holds easily six hundred amphors  and the thickness of this Scythian bowl is six fingers. This then the natives of the place told me had been made of arrow-heads: for their king  they said  whose name was Ariantas  wishing to know how many the Scythians were  ordered all the Scythians to bring one arrow-head  each from his own arrow  and whosoever should not bring one  he threatened with death. So a great multitude of arrow-heads was brought  and he resolved to make of them a memorial and to leave it behind him: from these then  they said  he made this bronze bowl and dedicated it in this place Exampaios.,mashup

One thing however shall be mentioned which it has to show  and which is worthy of wonder even besides the rivers and the greatness of the plain  that is to say  they point out a footprint of Heracles in the rock by the bank of the river Tyras  which in shape is like the mark of a man's foot but in size is two cubits long. This then is such as I have said; and I will go back now to the history which I was about to tell at first.,mashup

Then one of the Persians  Oiobazos  made request to Dareios that as he had three sons and all were serving in the expedition  one might be left behind for him: and Dareios said that as he was a friend and made a reasonable request  he would leave behind all the sons. So Oiobazos was greatly rejoiced  supposing that his sons had been freed from service  but Dareios commanded those who had the charge of such things to put to death all the sons of Oiobazos.,mashup

These then were left  having been slain upon the spot where they were: and Dareios meanwhile set forth from Susa and arrived at the place on the Bosphorus where the bridge of ships had been made  in the territory of Chalcedon; and there he embarked in a ship and sailed to the so-called Kyanean rocks  which the Hellenes say formerly moved backwards and forwards; and taking his seat at the temple he gazed upon the Pontus  which is a sight well worth seeing. Of all seas indeed it is the most marvellous in its nature. The length of it is eleven thousand one hundred furlongs  and the breadth  where it is broadest  three thousand three hundred: and of this great Sea the mouth is but four furlongs broad  and the length of the mouth  that is of the neck of water which is called Bosphorus  where  as I said  the bridge of ships had been made  is not less than a hundred and twenty furlongs. This Bosphorus extends to the Propontis; and the Propontis  being in breadth five hundred furlongs and in length one thousand four hundred  has its outlet into the Hellespont  which is but seven furlongs broad at the narrowest place  though it is four hundred furlongs in length: and the Hellespont runs out into that expanse of sea which is called the Egean.,mashup

These measurements I have made as follows:— a ship completes on an average in a long day a distance of seventy thousand fathoms  and in a night sixty thousand. Now we know that to the river Phasis from the mouth of the Sea (for it is here that the Pontus is longest ) is a voyage of nine days and eight nights  which amounts to one hundred and eleven myriads of fathoms; and these fathoms are eleven thousand one hundred furlongs. Then from the land of the Sindians to Themiskyra on the river Thermodon (for here is the broadest part of the Pontus ) it is a voyage of three days and two nights  which amounts to thirty-three myriads of fathoms or three thousand three hundred furlongs. This Pontus then and also the Bosphorus and the Hellespont have been measured by me thus  and their nature is such as has been said: and this Pontus also has a lake which has its outlet into it  which lake is not much less in size than the Pontus itself  and it is called Maiotis andMother of the Pontus.,mashup

The whole number of them without the naval force was reckoned to be seventy myriads including cavalry  and ships had been gathered together to the number of six hundred. These pillars the Byzantians conveyed to their city after the events of which I speak  and used them for the altar of Artemis Orthosia  excepting one stone  which was left standing by the side of the temple of Dionysos in Byzantion  covered over with Assyrian characters. Now the place on the Bosphorus where Dareios made his bridge is  as I conclude  midway between Byzantion and the temple at the mouth of the Pontus.,mashup

So the fleet sailed through between the Kyanean rocks and made straight for the Ister; and then they sailed up the river a two days' voyage from the sea and proceeded to make a bridge across the neck  as it were  of the river  where the mouths of the Ister part off. Dareios meanwhile  having crossed the Bosphorus on the floating bridge  was advancing through Thrace  and when he came to the sources of the river Tearos he encamped for three days.,mashup

This Salmoxis I hear from the Hellenes who dwell about the Hellespont and the Pontus  was a man  and he became a slave in Samos  and was in fact a slave of Pythagoras the son of Mnesarchos. Then having become free he gained great wealth  and afterwards returned to his own land: and as the Thracians both live hardly and are rather simple-minded  this Salmoxis  being acquainted with the Ionian way of living and with manners more cultivated than the Thracians were used to see  since he had associated with Hellenes (and not only that but with Pythagoras  not the least able philosopher of the Hellenes )  prepared a banqueting-hall  where he received and feasted the chief men of the tribe and instructed them meanwhile that neither he himself nor his guests nor their descendants in succession after them would die; but that they would come to a place where they would live for ever and have all things good. While he was doing that which has been mentioned and was saying these things  he was making for himself meanwhile a chamber under the ground; and when his chamber was finished  he disappeared from among the Thracians and went down into the underground chamber  where he continued to live for three years: and they grieved for his loss and mourned for him as dead. Then in the fourth year he appeared to the Thracians  and in this way the things which Salmoxis said became credible to them.,mashup

These  I say  having such manners as I have said  were subdued by the Persians and accompanied the rest of the army: and when Dareios and with him the land-army arrived at the Ister  then after all had passed over  Dareios commanded the Ionians to break up the floating bridge and to accompany him by land  as well as the rest of the troops which were in the ships: and when the Ionians were just about to break it up and to do that which he commanded  Coës the son of Erxander  who was commander of the Mytilenians  said thus to Dareios  having first inquired whether he was disposed to listen to an opinion from one who desired to declare it:O king  seeing that thou art about to march upon a land where no cultivated ground will be seen nor any inhabited town  do thou therefore let this bridge remain where it is  leaving to guard it those same men who constructed it. Then  if we find the Scythians and fare as we desire  we have a way of return; and also even if we shall not be able to find them  at least our way of return is secured: for that we should be worsted by the Scythians in fight I never feared yet  but rather that we might not be able to find them  and might suffer some disaster in wandering about. Perhaps some one will say that in speaking thus I am speaking for my own advantage  in order that I may remain behind; but in truth I am bringing forward  O king  the opinion which I found best for thee  and I myself will accompany thee and not be left behind. With this opinion Dareios was very greatly pleased and made answer to him in these words:Friend from Lesbos  when I have returned safe to my house  be sure that thou appear before me  in order that I may requite thee with good deeds for good counsel.,mashup

Having thus said and having tied sixty knots in a thong  he called the despots of the Ionians to speak with him and said as follows:Men of Ionia  know that I have given up the opinion which I formerly declared with regard to the bridge; and do ye keep this thong and do as I shall say:— so soon as ye shall have seen me go forward against the Scythians  from that time begin  and untie a knot on each day: and if within this time I am not here  and ye find that the days marked by the knots have passed by  then sail away to your own lands.

Now in front of Scythia in the direction towards the sea lies Thrace; and where a bay is formed in this land  there begins Scythia  into which the Ister flows out  the mouth of the river being turned towards the South-East Wind. Beginning at the Ister then I am about to describe the coast land of the true Scythia  with regard to measurement. At once from the Ister begins this original land of Scythia  and it lies towards the midday and the South Wind  extending as far as the city called Carkinitis. After this the part which lies on the coast of the same sea still  a country which is mountainous and runs out in the direction of the Pontus  is occupied by the Tauric race  as far as the peninsula which is called theRugged Chersonese; and this extends to the sea which lies towards the East Wind: for two sides of the Scythian boundaries lie along by the sea  one by the sea on the South  and the other by that on the East  just as it is with Attica: and in truth the Tauroi occupy a part of Scythia which has much resemblance to Attica; it is as if in Attica another race and not the Athenians occupied the hill region of Sunion  supposing it to project more at the point into the sea  that region namely which is cut off by a line from Thoricos to Anaphlystos. Such I say  if we may be allowed to compare small things such as this with great  is the form of the Tauric land. For him however who has not sailed along this part of the coast of Attica I will make it clear by another comparison:— it is as if in Iapygia another race and not the Iapygians had cut off for themselves and were holding that extremity of the land which is bounded by a line beginning at the harbour of Brentesion and running to Taras. And in mentioning these two similar cases I am suggesting many other things also to which the Tauric land has resemblance.,mashup

Scythia then being looked upon as a four-sided figure with two of its sides bordered by the sea  has its border lines equal to one another in each direction  that which tends inland and that which runs along by the sea: for from Ister to the Borysthenes is ten days' journey  and from the Borysthenes to the Maiotian lake ten days' more; and the distance inland to the Melanchlainoi  who are settled above the Scythians  is a journey of twenty days. Now I have reckoned the day's journey at two hundred furlongs: and by this reckoning the cross lines of Scythia would be four thousand furlongs in length  and the perpendiculars which tend inland would be the same number of furlongs. Such is the size of this land.,mashup

This divinity to whom they sacrifice  the Tauroi themselves say is Iphigeneia the daughter of Agamemnon. Whatsoever enemies they have conquered they treat in this fashion:— each man cuts off a head and bears it away to his house; then he impales it on a long stake and sets it up above his house raised to a great height  generally above the chimney; and they say that these are suspended above as guards to preserve the whole house. This people has its living by plunder and war.,mashup

These men it would seem are wizards; for it is said of them by the Scythians and by the Hellenes who are settled in the Scythian land that once in every year each of the Neuroi becomes a wolf for a few days and then returns again to his original form.

However by the Hellenes the Budinoi also are called Gelonians  not being rightly so called. Their land is all thickly overgrown with forests of all kinds of trees  and in the thickest forest there is a large and deep lake  and round it marshy ground and reeds. In this are caught otters and beavers and certainly other wild animals with square-shaped faces. The fur of these is sewn as a fringe round their coats of skin  and the testicles are made use of by them for curing diseases of the womb.,mashup

About the Sauromatai the following tale is told:— When the Hellenes had fought with the Amazons — now the Amazons are called by the Scythians  Oiorpata  which name means in the Hellenic tongueslayers of men  forman they call  oior  and  pata  meansto slay — then  as the story goes  the Hellenes  having conquered them in the battle at the Thermodon  were sailing away and conveying with them in three ships as many Amazons as they were able to take prisoners. These in the open sea set upon the men and cast them out of the ships; but they knew nothing about ships  nor how to use rudders or sails or oars  and after they had cast out the men they were driven about by wave and wind and came to that part of the Maiotian lake where Cremnoi stands; now Cremnoi is in the land of the free Scythians. There the Amazons disembarked from their ships and made their way into the country  and having met first with a troop of horses feeding they seized them  and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians.,mashup

The Scythians meanwhile were not able to understand the matter  for they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged  but were in wonder as to whence they had come and thought that they were men  of an age corresponding to their appearance: and finally they fought a battle against them  and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead  and thus they discovered that they were women. They took counsel therefore and resolved by no means to go on trying to kill them  but to send against them the youngest men from among themselves  making conjecture of the number so as to send just as many men as there were women. These were told to encamp near them  and do whatsoever they should do; if however the women should come after them  they were not to fight but to retire before them  and when the women stopped  they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them.,mashup

Now the Amazons at midday used to scatter abroad either one by one or by two together  dispersing to a distance from one another to ease themselves; and the Scythians also having perceived this did the same thing: and one of the Scythians came near to one of those Amazons who were apart by themselves  and she did not repulse him but allowed him to lie with her: and she could not speak to him  for they did not understand one another's speech  but she made signs to him with her hand to come on the following day to the same place and to bring another with him  signifying to him that there should be two of them  and that she would bring another with her. The young man therefore  when he returned  reported this to the others; and on the next day he came himself to the place and also brought another  and he found the Amazon awaiting him with another in her company.

So when they understood one another  the men spoke to the Amazons as follows:We have parents and we have possessions; now therefore let us no longer lead a life of this kind  but let us go away to the main body of our people and dwell with them; and we will have you for wives and no others. They however spoke thus in reply:We should not be able to live with your women  for we and they have not the same customs. We shoot with bows and hurl javelins and ride horses  but the works of women we never learnt; whereas your women do none of these things which we said  but stay in the waggons and work at the works of women  neither going out to the chase nor anywhither else. We therefore should not be able to live in agreement with them: but if ye desire to keep us for your wives and to be thought honest men  go to your parents and obtain from them your share of the goods  and then let us go and dwell by ourselves.,mashup

To the kings of these nations then  which have been mentioned in order  the messengers of the Scythians came  finding them gathered together  and spoke declaring to them how the Persian king  after having subdued all things to himself in the other continent  had laid a bridge over the neck of the Bosphorus and had crossed over to that continent  and having crossed over and subdued the Thracians  was making a bridge over the river Ister  desiring to bring under his power all these regions also.Do ye therefore  they said by no means stand aloof and allow us to be destroyed  but let us become all of one mind and oppose him who is coming against us. If ye shall not do so  we on our part shall either be forced by necessity to leave our land  or we shall stay in it and make a treaty with the invader; for what else can we do if ye are not willing to help us? and for you after this it will be in no respect easier; for the Persian has come not at all less against you than against us  nor will it content him to subdue us and abstain from you. And of the truth of that which we say we will mention a strong evidence: if the Persian had been making his expedition against us alone  because he desired to take vengeance for the former servitude  he ought to have abstained from all the rest and to have come at once to invade our land  and he would thus have made it clear to all that he was marching to fight against the Scythians and not against the rest. In fact however  ever since he crossed over to this continent  he has compelled all who came in his way to submit to him  and he holds under him now not only the other Thracians but also the Getai  who are our nearest neighbours.,mashup

As it is however  ye on the one hand made invasion without us into their land  and bare rule over the Persians for so long a time as God permitted you; and they in their turn  since the same God stirs them up  are repaying you with the like. As for us however  neither at that time did we do any wrong to these men nor now shall we attempt to do any wrong to them unprovoked: if however the Persians shall come against our land also  and do wrong first to us  we also shall refuse to submit: but until we shall see this  we shall remain by ourselves  for we are of opinion that the Persians have come not against us  but against those who were the authors of the wrong.,mashup

This was one division of their kingdom  appointed to go by the way which has been said; and the other two of the kingdoms  the large one over which Idanthyrsos was king  and the third of which Taxakis was king  were to join together in one  with the Gelonians and the Budinoi added to them  and they also were to retire before the Persians one day's march in front of them  going on out of their way and doing that which had been planned. First they were to move on straight for the countries which had refused to give their alliance  in order that they might involve these also in the war  and though these had not voluntarily undertaken the war with the Persians  they were to involve them in it nevertheless against their will; and after that they were to return to their own land and attack the enemy  if it should seem good to them in council so to do.,mashup

After this  since they had directed their march towards the first of the divisions  the Persians continued to pursue towards the East and the river Tanais; and when the Scythians crossed over the river Tanais  the Persians crossed over after them and continued still to pursue  until they had passed quite through the land of the Sauromatai and had come to that of the Budinoi.,mashup

Now so long as the Persians were passing through Scythia and the land of the Sauromatai  they had nothing to destroy  seeing that the land was bare  but when they invaded the land of the Budinoi  then they fell in with the wooden wall  which had been deserted by the Budinoi and left wholly unoccupied  and this they destroyed by fire. Having done so they continued to follow on further in the tracks of the enemy  until they had passed through the whole of this land and had arrived at the desert. This desert region is occupied by no men  and it lies above the land of the Budinoi  extending for a seven days' journey; and above this desert dwell the Thyssagetai  and four large rivers flow from them through the land of the Maiotians and run into that which is called the Maiotian lake  their names being as follows — Lycos  Oaros  Tanais  Syrgis.,mashup

Having so done he began to build eight large fortifications at equal distances from one another  that is to say about sixty furlongs  of which the ruins still existed down to my time; and while he was occupied in this  the Scythians whom he was pursuing came round by the upper parts and returned back to Scythia. Accordingly  since these had altogether disappeared and were no longer seen by the Persians at all  Dareios left those fortifications half finished  and turning back himself began to go towards the West  supposing that these were the whole body of the Scythians and that they were flying towards the West.,mashup

And marching his army as quickly as possible  when he came to Scythia he met with the two divisions of the Scythians together  and having fallen in with these he continued to pursue them  while they retired out of his way one day's journey in advance: and as Dareios did not cease to come after them  the Scythians according to the plan which they had made continued to retire before him towards the land of those who had refused to give their alliance  and first towards that of the Melanchlainoi; and when Scythians and Persians both together had invaded and disturbed these  the Scythians led the way to the country of the Androphagoi; and when these had also been disturbed  they proceeded to the land of the Neuroi; and while these too were being disturbed  the Scythians went on retiring before the enemy to the Agathyrsians. The Agathyrsians however  seeing that their next neighbours also were flying from the Scythians and had been disturbed  sent a herald before the Scythians invaded their land and proclaimed to the Scythians not to set foot upon their confines  warning them that if they should attempt to invade the country  they would first have to fight with them. The Agathyrsians then having given this warning came out in arms to their borders  meaning to drive off those who were coming upon them; but the Melanchlainoi and Androphagoi and Neuroi  when the Persians and Scythians together invaded them  did not betake themselves to brave defence but forgot their former threat and fled in confusion ever further towards the North to the desert region. The Scythians however  when the Agathyrsians had warned them off  did not attempt any more to come to these  but led the Persians from the country of the Neuroi back to their own land.,mashup

To this the king of the Scythians Idanthyrsos made answer thus:My case  O Persian  stands thus:— Never yet did I fly because I was afraid  either before this time from any other man  or now from thee; nor have I done anything different now from that which I was wont to do also in time of peace: and as to the cause why I do not fight with thee at once  this also I will declare to thee. We have neither cities nor land sown with crops  about which we should fear lest they should be captured or laid waste  and so join battle more speedily with you; but if it be necessary by all means to come to this speedily  know that we have sepulchres in which our fathers are buried; therefore come now  find out these and attempt to destroy them  and ye shall know then whether we shall fight with you for the sepulchres or whether we shall not fight. Before that however  unless the motion comes upon us  we shall not join battle with thee. About fighting let so much as has been said suffice; but as to masters  I acknowledge none over me but Zeus my ancestor and Hestia the queen of the Scythians. To thee then in place of gifts of earth and water I shall send such things as it is fitting that thou shouldest receive; and in return for thy saying that thou art my master  for that I say  woe betide thee. This is the proverbialsaying of the Scythians.,mashup

The herald then had departed to report this to Dareios; and the kings of the Scythians  having heard mention of subjection to a master  were filled with wrath. They sent accordingly the division which was appointed to be joined with the Sauromatai  that division of which Scopasis was in command  bidding them come to speech with the Ionians  namely those who were guarding the bridge of the Ister  and meanwhile they who were left behind resolved not to lead the Persians wandering about any more  but to attack them constantly as they were getting provisions. Therefore they observed the soldiers of Dareios as they got provisions  and did that which they had determined: and the cavalry of the Scythians always routed that of the enemy  but the Persian horsemen as they fled fell back upon the men on foot  and these would come up to their assistance; and meanwhile the Scythians when they had driven in the cavalry turned back  fearing the men on foot. Also by night the Scythians used to make similar attacks:,mashup

The asses accordingly by riotously braying used to throw into confusion the cavalry of the Scythians; and often  as they were in the middle of riding against the Persians  when the horses heard the voice of the asses they turned back in confusion and were possessed with wonder  pricking up their ears  because they had never heard such a voice nor seen the form of the creature before.,mashup

So far then the Persians had the advantage for a small part of the war. But the Scythians  whenever they saw that the Persians were disquieted  then in order that they might remain a longer time in Scythia and in remaining might suffer by being in want of everything  would leave some of their own cattle behind with the herdsmen  while they themselves rode out of the way to another place  and the Persians would come upon the cattle and take them  and having taken them they were elated at what they had done.,mashup

As this happened often  at length Dareios began to be in straits; and the kings of the Scythians perceiving this sent a herald bearing as gifts to Dareios a bird and a mouse and a frog and five arrows. The Persians accordingly asked the bearer of the gifts as to the meaning of the gifts which were offered; but he said that nothing more had been commanded to him but to give them and get away as speedily as possible; and he bade the Persians find out for themselves  if they had wisdom  that which the gifts were meant to express.,mashup

Having heard this the Persians took counsel with one another; and the opinion of Dareios was that the Scythians were giving to him both themselves and also earth and water  making his conjecture by this  namely that a mouse is produced in the earth and feeds on the same produce of the earth as man  and a frog in the water  while a bird has great resemblance to a horse; and moreover that in giving the arrows they were delivering up their own might in battle. This was the opinion expressed by Dareios; but the opinion of Gobryas  one of the seven men who killed the Magian  was at variance with it  for he conjectured that the gifts expressed this:Unless ye become birds and fly up into the heaven  O Persians  or become mice and sink down under the earth  or become frogs and leap into the lakes  ye shall not return back home  but shall be smitten by these arrows.,mashup

Now when the Scythians had been placed in battle-array  a hare darted through them into the space between the two armies  and each company of them  as they saw the hare  began to run after it. When the Scythians were thus thrown into disorder and were raising loud cries  Dareios asked what was this clamour arising from the enemy; and hearing that they were running after the hare  he said to those men to whom he was wont to say things at other times:These men have very slight regard for us  and I perceive now that Gobryas spoke rightly about the Scythian gifts. Seeing then that now I myself too think that things are so  we have need of good counsel  in order that our retreat homewards may be safely made. To this replied Gobryas and said:O king  even by report I was almost assured of the difficulty of dealing with these men; and when I came I learnt it still more thoroughly  since I saw that they were mocking us. Now therefore my opinion is  that as soon as night comes on  we kindle the camp-fires as we are wont to do at other times also  and deceive with a false tale those of our men who are weakest to endure hardships  and tie up all the asses and get us away  before either the Scythians make for the Ister to destroy the bridge or something be resolved by the Ionians which may be our ruin.,mashup

Thus Gobryas advised; and after this  when night came on  Dareios acted on this opinion. Those of his men who were weakened by fatigue and whose loss was of least account  these he left behind in the camp  and the asses also tied up: and for the following reasons he left behind the asses and the weaker men of his army — the asses in order that they might make a noise which should be heard  and the men really because of their weakness  but on a pretence stated openly that he was about to attack the Scythians with the effective part of the army  and that they meanwhile were to be defenders of the camp. Having thus instructed those who were left behind  and having kindled camp-fires  Dareios hastened by the quickest way towards the Ister: and the asses  having no longer about them the usual throng  very much more for that reason caused their voice to be heard; so the Scythians  hearing the asses  supposed surely that the Persians were remaining in their former place.,mashup

But when it was day  those who were left behind perceived that they had been betrayed by Dareios  and they held out their hands in submission to the Scythians  telling them what their case was; and the Scythians  when they heard this  joined together as quickly as possible  that is to say the two combined divisions of the Scythians and the single division  and also the Sauromatai  Budinoi  and Gelonians  and began to pursue the Persians  making straight for the Ister: but as the Persian army for the most part consisted of men on foot  and was not acquainted with the roads (the roads not being marked with tracks )  while the Scythian army consisted of horsemen and was acquainted with the shortest cuts along the way  they missed one another and the Scythians arrived at the bridge much before the Persians. Then having learnt that the Persians had not yet arrived  they said to the Ionians who were in the ships:Ionians  the days of your number are past  and ye are not acting uprightly in that ye yet remain waiting: but as ye stayed before from fear  so now break up the passage as quickly as ye may  and depart free and unhurt  feeling thankfulness both to the gods and to the Scythians: and him who was formerly your master we will so convince  that he shall never again march with an army upon any nation.,mashup

Upon this the Ionians took counsel together; and Miltiades the Athenian on the one hand  who was commander and despot of the men of the Chersonese in Hellespont  was of opinion that they should follow the advice of the Scythians and set Ionia free: but Histiaios the Milesian was of the opposite opinion to this; for he said that at the present time it was by means of Dareios that each one of them was ruling as despot over a city; and if the power of Dareios should be destroyed  neither he himself would be able to bear rule over the Milesians  nor would any other of them be able to bear rule over any other city; for each of the cities would choose to have popular rather than despotic rule. When Histiaios declared his opinion thus  forthwith all turned to this opinion  whereas at the first they were adopting that of Miltiades.,mashup

When these adopted the opinion of Histiaios  they resolved to add to it deeds and words as follows  namely to break up that part of the bridge which was on the side towards the Scythians  to break it up  I say  for a distance equal to the range of an arrow  both in order that they might be thought to be doing something  though in fact they were doing nothing  and for fear that the Scythians might make an attempt using force and desiring to cross the Ister by the bridge: and in breaking up that part of the bridge which was towards Scythia they resolved to say that they would do all that which the Scythians desired. This they added to the opinion proposed  and then Histiaios coming forth from among them made answer to the Scythians as follows:Scythians  ye are come bringing good news  and it is a timely haste that ye make to bring it; and ye on your part give us good guidance  while we on ours render to you suitable service. For  as ye see  we are breaking up the passage  and we shall show all zeal in our desire to be free: and while we are breaking up the bridge  it is fitting that ye should be seeking for those of whom ye speak  and when ye have found them  that ye should take vengeance on them on behalf of us as well as of yourselves in such manner as they deserve.,mashup

The Scythians then  believing for the second time that the Ionians were speaking the truth  turned back to make search for the Persians  but they missed altogether their line of march through the land. Of this the Scythians themselves were the cause  since they had destroyed the pastures for horses in that region and had choked up with earth the springs of water; for if they had not done this  it would have been possible for them easily  if they desired it  to discover the Persians: but as it was  by those things wherein they thought they had taken their measures best  they failed of success. The Scythians then on their part were passing through those regions of their own land where there was grass for the horses and springs of water  and were seeking for the enemy there  thinking that they too were taking a course in their retreat through such country as this; while the Persians in fact marched keeping carefully to the track which they had made before  and so they found the passage of the river  though with difficulty: and as they arrived by night and found the bridge broken up  they were brought to the extreme of fear  lest the Ionians should have deserted them.,mashup

He then was doing thus; and at this very same time a great expedition was being made also against Libya  on an occasion which I shall relate when I have first related this which follows.— The children's children of those who voyaged in the Argo  having been driven forth by those Pelasgians who carried away at Brauron the women of the Athenians — having been driven forth I say by these from Lemnos  had departed and sailed to Lacedemon  and sitting down on Mount Ta�getos they kindled a fire. The Lacedemonians seeing this sent a messenger to inquire who they were and from whence; and they answered the question of the messenger saying that they were Minyai and children of heroes who sailed in the Argo  for these  they said  had put in to Lemnos and propagated the race of which they sprang. The Lacedemonians having heard the story of the descent of the Minyai  sent a second time and asked for what purpose they had come into the country and were causing a fire to blaze. They said that they had been cast out by the Pelasgians  and were come now to the land of their fathers  for most just it was that this should so be done; and they said that their request was to be permitted to dwell with these  having a share of civil rights and a portion allotted to them of the land. And the Lacedemonians were content to receive the Minyai upon the terms which they themselves desired  being most of all impelled to do this by the fact that the sons of Tyndareus were voyagers in the Argo. So having received the Minyai they gave them a share of land and distributed them in the tribes; and they forthwith made marriages  and gave in marriage to others the women whom they brought with them from Lemnos.,mashup

However  when no very long time had passed  the Minyai forthwith broke out into insolence  asking for a share of the royal power and also doing other impious things: therefore the Lacedemonians resolved to put them to death; and having seized them they cast them into a prison. Now the Lacedemonians put to death by night all those whom they put to death  but no man by day. When therefore they were just about to kill them  the wives of the Minyai  being native Spartans and daughters of the first citizens of Sparta  entreated to be allowed to enter the prison and come to speech every one with her own husband: and they let them pass in  not supposing that any craft would be practised by them. They however  when they had entered  delivered to their husbands all the garments which they were wearing  and themselves received those of their husbands: thus the Minyai having put on the women's clothes went forth out of prison as women  and having escaped in this manner they went again to Ta�getos and sat down there.,mashup

Now at this very same time Theras the son of Autesion  the son of Tisamenos  the son of Thersander  the son of Polyneikes  was preparing to set forth from Lacedemon to found a settlement. This Theras  who was of the race of Cadmos  was mother's brother to the sons of Aristodemos  Eurysthenes and Procles; and while these sons were yet children  Theras as their guardian held the royal power in Sparta. When however his nephews were grown and had taken the power into their hands  then Theras  being grieved that he should be ruled by others after he had tasted of rule himself  said that he would not remain in Lacedemon  but would sail away to his kinsmen. Now there were in the island which is now called Thera  but formerly was called Callista  descendants of Membliaros the son of Poikiles  a Phenician: for Cadmos the son of Agenor in his search for Europa put in to land at the island which is now called Thera; and  whether it was that the country pleased him when he had put to land  or whether he chose to do so for any other reason  he left in this island  besides other Phenicians  Membliaros also  of his own kinsmen. These occupied the island called Callista for eight generations of men  before Theras came from Lacedemon.,mashup

To these then  I say  Theras was preparing to set forth  taking with him people from the tribes  and intending to settle together with those who have been mentioned  not with any design to drive them out  but on the contrary claiming them very strongly as kinfolk. And when the Minyai after having escaped from the prison went and sat down on Ta�getos  Theras entreated of the Lacedemonians  as they were proposing to put them to death  that no slaughter might take place  and at the same time he engaged himself to take them forth out of the land. The Lacedemonians having agreed to this proposal  he sailed away with three thirty-oared galleys to the descendants of Membliaros  not taking with him by any means all the Minyai  but a few only; for the greater number of them turned towards the land of the Paroreatai and Caucones  and having driven these out of their country  they parted themselves into six divisions and founded in their territory the following towns — Lepreon  Makistos  Phrixai  Pyrgos  Epion  Nudion; of these the Eleians sacked the greater number within my own lifetime. The island meanwhile got its name of Thera after Theras who led the settlement.,mashup

Up to this point of the story the Lacedemonians agree in their report with the men of Thera; but in what is to come it is those of Thera alone who report that it happened as follows. Grinnos the son of Aisanios  a descendant of the Theras who has been mentioned  and king of the island of Thera  came to Delphi bringing the offering of a hecatomb from his State; and there were accompanying him  besides others of the citizens  also Battos the son of Polymnestos  who was by descent of the family of Euphemos of the race of the Minyai. Now when Grinnos the king of the Theraians was consulting the Oracle about other matters  the Pythian prophetess gave answer bidding him found a city in Libya; and he made reply saying:Lord  I am by this time somewhat old and heavy to stir  but do thou bid some one of these younger ones do this. As he thus said he pointed towards Battos. So far at that time: but afterwards when he had come away they were in difficulty about the saying of the Oracle  neither having any knowledge of Libya  in what part of the earth it was  nor venturing to send a colony to the unknown.,mashup

Then after this for seven years there was no rain in Thera  and in these years all the trees in their island were withered up excepting one: and when the Theraians consulted the Oracle  the Pythian prophetess alleged this matter of colonising Libya to be the cause. As then they had no remedy for their evil  they sent messengers to Crete  to find out whether any of the Cretans or of the sojourners in Crete had ever come to Libya. These as they wandered round about the country came also the city of Itanos  and there they met with a fisher for purple named Corobios  who said that he had been carried away by winds and had come to Libya  and in Libya to the island of Platea. This man they persuaded by payment of money and took him to Thera  and from Thera there set sail men to explore  at first not many in number; and Corobios having guided them to this same island of Platea  they left Corobios there  leaving behind with him provisions for a certain number of months  and sailed themselves as quickly as possible to make report about the island to the men of Thera.,mashup

Since however these stayed away longer than the time appointed  Corobios found himself destitute; and after this a ship of Samos  of which the master was Colaios  while sailing to Egypt was carried out of its course and came to this island of Platea; and the Samians hearing from Corobios the whole story left him provisions for a year. They themselves then put out to sea from the island and sailed on  endeavouring to reach Egypt but carried away continually by the East Wind; and as the wind did not cease to blow  they passed through the Pillars of Heracles and came to Tartessos  guided by divine providence. Now this trading-place was at that time untouched by any  so that when these returned back home they made profit from their cargo greater than any other Hellenes of whom we have certain knowledge  with the exception at least of Sostratos the son of Laodamas the Eginetan  for with him it is not possible for any other man to contend. And the Samians set apart six talents  the tenth part of their gains  and had a bronze vessel made like an Argolic mixing- bowl with round it heads of griffins projecting in a row; and this they dedicated as an offering in the temple of Hera  setting as supports under it three colossal statues of bronze seven cubits in height  resting upon their knees. By reason first of this deed great friendship was formed by those of Kyrene and Thera with the Samians.,mashup

This is the report of the Theraians; and for the remainder of the account from this point onwards the Theraians are in agreement with the men of Kyrene: from this point onwards  I say  since in what concerns Battos the Kyrenians tell by no means the same tale as those of Thera; for their account is this:— There is in Crete a city called O�xos in which one Etearchos became king  who when he had a daughter  whose mother was dead  named Phronime  took to wife another woman notwithstanding. She having come in afterwards  thought fit to be a stepmother to Phronime in deed as well as in name  giving her evil treatment and devising everything possible to her hurt; and at last she brings against her a charge of lewdness and persuades her husband that the truth is so. He then being convinced by his wife  devised an unholy deed against the daughter: for there was in O�xos one Themison  a merchant of Thera  whom Etearchos took to himself as a guest-friend and caused him to swear that he would surely serve him in whatsoever he should require: and when he had caused him to swear this  he brought and delivered to him his daughter and bade him take her away and cast her into the sea. Themison then was very greatly vexed at the deceit practised in the matter of the oath  and he dissolved his guest-friendship and did as follows  that is to say  he received the girl and sailed away  and when he got out into the open sea  to free himself from blame as regards the oath which Etearchos had made him swear  he tied her on each side with ropes and let her down into the sea  and then drew her up and came to Thera.,mashup

After that  Polymnestos  a man of repute among the Theraians  received Phronime from him and kept her as his concubine; and in course of time there was born to him from her a son with an impediment in his voice and lisping  to whom  as both Theraians and Kyrenians say  was given the name Battos  but I think that some other name was then given  and he was named Battos instead of this after he came to Libya  taking for himself this surname from the oracle which was given to him at Delphi and from the rank which he had obtained; for the Libyans call a king  battos: and for this reason  I think  the Pythian prophetess in her prophesying called him so  using the Libyan tongue  because she knew that he would be a king in Libya. For when he had grown to be a man  he came to Delphi to inquire about his voice; and when he asked  the prophetess thus answered him:For a voice thou camest  O Battos  but thee lord Phoebus Apollo Sendeth as settler forth to the Libyan land sheep-abounding  just as if she should say using the Hellenic tongue For a voice thou camest  O king. He thus made answer:Lord  I came to thee to inquire concerning my voice  but thou answerest me other things which are not possible  bidding me go as a settler to Libya; but with what power  or with what force of men should I go ? Thus saying he did not at all persuade her to give him any other reply; and as she was prophesying to him again the same things as before  Battos departed while she was yet speaking  and went away to Thera.,mashup

After this the Theraians sent Battos with two fifty-oared galleys; and these sailed to Libya  and then came away back to Thera  for they did not know what else to do: and the Theraians pelted them with missiles when they endeavoured to land  and would not allow them to put to shore  but bade them sail back again.

In this they continued to dwell two years; but as they had no prosperity  they left one of their number behind and all the rest sailed away to Delphi  and having come to the Oracle they consulted it  saying that they were dwelling in Libya and that  though they were dwelling there  they fared none the better: and the Pythian prophetess made answer to them thus:Better than I if thou knowest the Libyan land sheep-abounding  Not having been there than I who have been  at thy wisdom I wonder. Having heard this Battos and his companions sailed away back again; for in fact the god would not let them off from the task of settlement till they had come to Libya itself: and having arrived at the island and taken up him whom they had left  they made a settlement in Libya itself at a spot opposite the island  called Aziris  which is enclosed by most fair woods on both sides and a river flows by it on one side.,mashup

In this spot they dwelt for six years; and in the seventh year the Libyans persuaded them to leave it  making request and saying that they would conduct them to a better region. So the Libyans led them from that place making them start towards evening; and in order that the Hellenes might not see the fairest of all the regions as they passed through it  they led them past it by night  having calculated the time of daylight: and this region is called Irasa. Then having conducted them to the so-called spring of Apollo  they said Hellenes  here is a fit place for you to dwell  for here the heaven is pierced with holes.,mashup

Now during the lifetime of the first settler Battos  who reigned forty years  and of his son Arkesilaos  who reigned sixteen years  the Kyrenians continued to dwell there with the same number as when they first set forth to the colony; but in the time of the third king  called Battos the Prosperous  the Pythian prophetess gave an oracle wherein she urged the Hellenes in general to sail and join with the Kyrenians in colonising Libya. For the Kyrenians invited them  giving promise of a division of land; and the oracle which she uttered was as follows:Who to the land much desir�d  to Libya  afterwards cometh  After the land be divided  I say he shall some day repent it. Then great numbers were gathered at Kyrene  and the Libyans who dwelt round had much land cut off from their possessions; therefore they with their king whose name was Adicran  as they were not only deprived of their country but also were dealt with very insolently by the Kyrenians  sent to Egypt and delivered themselves over to Apries king of Egypt. He then having gathered a great army of Egyptians  sent it against Kyrene; and the men of Kyrene marched out to the region of Irasa and to the spring Theste  and there both joined battle with the Egyptians and defeated them in the battle: for since the Egyptians had not before made trial of the Hellenes in fight and therefore despised them  they were so slaughtered that but few of them returned back to Egypt. In consequence of this and because they laid the blame of it upon Apries  the Egyptians revolted from him.,mashup

This Battos had a son called Arkesilaos  who first when he became king made a quarrel with his own brothers  until they finally departed to another region of Libya  and making the venture for themselves founded that city which was then and is now called Barca; and at the same time as they founded this  they induced the Libyans to revolt from the Kyrenians. After this  Arkesilaos made an expedition against those Libyans who had received them and who had also revolted from Kyrene  and the Libyans fearing him departed and fled towards the Eastern tribes of Libyans: and Arkesilaos followed after them as they fled  until he arrived in his pursuit at Leucon in Libya  and there the Libyans resolved to attack him. Accordingly they engaged battle and defeated the Kyrenians so utterly that seven thousand hoplites of the Kyrenians fell there. After this disaster Arkesilaos  being sick and having swallowed a potion  was strangled by his brother Haliarchos  and Haliarchos was killed treacherously by the wife of Arkesilaos  whose name was Eryxo.,mashup

Then Battos the son of Arkesilaos succeeded to the kingdom  who was lame and not sound in his feet: and the Kyrenians with a view to the misfortune which had befallen them sent men to Delphi to ask what form of rule they should adopt  in order to live in the best way possible; and the Pythian prophetess bade them take to themselves a reformer of their State from Mantineia of the Arcadians. The men of Kyrene accordingly made request  and those of Mantineia gave them the man of most repute among their citizens  whose name was Demonax. This man therefore having come to Kyrene and having ascertained all things exactly  in the first place caused them to have three tribes  distributing them thus:— one division he made of the Theraians and their dependants  another of the Peloponnesians and Cretans  and a third of all the islanders. Then secondly for the king Battos he set apart domains of land and priesthoods  but all the other powers which the kings used to possess before  he assigned as of public right to the people.,mashup

During the reign of this Battos things continued to be thus  but in the reign of his son Arkesilaos there arose much disturbance about the offices of the State: for Arkesilaos son of Battos the Lame and of Pheretime said that he would not suffer it to be according as the Mantineian Demonax had arranged  but asked to have back the royal rights of his forefathers. After this  stirring up strife he was worsted and went as an exile to Samos  and his mother to Salamis in Cyprus. Now at that time the ruler of Salamis was Euelthon  the same who dedicated as an offering the censer at Delphi  a work well worth seeing  which is placed in the treasury of the Corinthians. To him having come  Pheretime asked him for an army to restore herself and her son to Kyrene. Euelthon however was ready to give her anything else rather than that; and she when she received that which he gave her said that this too was a fair gift  but fairer still would be that other gift of an army for which she was asking. As she kept saying this to every thing which was given  at last Euelthon sent out to her a present of a golden spindle and distaff  with wool also upon it: and when Pheretime uttered again the same saying about this present  Euelthon said that such things as this were given as gifts to women and not an army.,mashup

Arkesilaos meanwhile  being in Samos  was gathering every one together by a promise of dividing land; and while a great host was being collected  Arkesilaos set out to Delphi to inquire of the Oracle about returning from exile: and the Pythian prophetess gave him this answer:For four named Battos and four named Arkesilaos  eight generations of men  Loxias grants to you to be kings of Kyrene  but beyond this he counsels you not even to attempt it. Thou however must keep quiet when thou hast come back to thy land; and if thou findest the furnace full of jars  heat not the jars fiercely  but let them go with a fair wind: if however thou heat the furnace fiercely  enter not thou into the place flowed round by water; for if thou dost thou shalt die  both thou and the bull which is fairer than all the rest.,mashup

Thus the Pythian prophetess gave answer to Arkesilaos; and he  having taken to him those in Samos  made his return to Kyrene; and when he had got possession of the power  he did not remember the saying of the Oracle but endeavoured to exact penalties from those of the opposite faction for having driven him out. Of these some escaped out of the country altogether  but some Arkesilaos got into his power and sent them away to Cyprus to be put to death. These were driven out of their course to Cnidos  and the men of Cnidos rescued them and sent them away to Thera. Some others however of the Kyrenians fled to a great tower belonging to Aglomachos a private citizen  and Arkesilaos burnt them by piling up brushwood round. Then after he had done the deed he perceived that the Oracle meant this  in that the Pythian prophetess forbade him  if he found the jars in the furnace  to heat them fiercely; and he voluntarily kept away from the city of the Kyrenians  fearing the death which had been prophesied by the Oracle and supposing that Kyrene was flowed round by water. Now he had to wife a kinswoman of his own  the daughter of the king of Barca whose name was Alazeir: to him he came  and men of Barca together with certain of the exiles from Kyrene  perceiving him going about in the market-place  killed him  and also besides him his father-in-law Alazeir. Arkesilaos accordingly  having missed the meaning of the oracle  whether with his will or against his will  fulfilled his own destiny.,mashup

His mother Pheretime meanwhile  so long as Arkesilaos having worked evil for himself dwelt at Barca  herself held the royal power of her son at Kyrene  both exercising his other rights and also sitting in council: but when she heard that her son had been slain in Barca  she departed and fled to Egypt: for she had on her side services done for Cambyses the son of Cyrus by Arkesilaos  since this was the Arkesilaos who had given over Kyrene to Cambyses and had laid a tribute upon himself.

For having heard and seen that Dareios desired to leave behind him as a memorial of himself a thing which had not been made by any other king  he imitated him  until at last he received his reward: for whereas Dareios refined gold and made it as pure as possible  and of this caused coins to be struck  Aryandes  being ruler of Egypt  did the same thing with silver; and even now the purest silver is that which is called Aryandic.

Having heard this  Aryandes at last sent away the army together with Pheretime. This charge then was the pretext alleged; but in fact the army was being sent out (as I believe ) for the purpose of subduing Libya: for of the Libyans there are many nations of nations of various kinds  and but few of them are subject to the king  while the greater number paid no regard to Dareios.,mashup

In the space within this limit lies off the coast the island of Platea  where the Kyrenians made their settlement; and on the coast of the mainland there is Port Menelaos  and Aziris  where the Kyrenians used to dwell. From this point begins the  silphion  and it extends along the coast from the island of Platea as far as the entrance of the Syrtis. This nation practises customs nearly resembling those of the rest.,mashup

Next after these Auschisai towards the West come the Nasamonians  a numerous race  who in the summer leave their flocks behind by the sea and go up to the region of Augila to gather the fruit of the date- palms  which grow in great numbers and very large and are all fruit- bearing: these hunt the wingless locusts  and they dry them in the sun and then pound them up  and after that they sprinkle them upon milk and drink them. Their custom is for each man to have many wives  and they make their intercourse with them common in nearly the same manner as the Massagetai  that is they set up a staff in front of the door and so have intercourse. When a Nasamonian man marries his first wife  the custom is for the bride on the first night to go through the whole number of the guests having intercourse with them  and each man when he has lain with her gives a gift  whatsoever he has brought with him from his house. The forms of oath and of divination which they use are as follows:— they swear by the men among themselves who are reported to have been the most righteous and brave  by these  I say  laying hands upon their tombs; and they divine by visiting the sepulchral mounds of their ancestors and lying down to sleep upon them after having prayed; and whatsoever thing the man sees in his dream  this he accepts. They practise also the exchange of pledges in the following manner  that is to say  one gives the other to drink from his hand  and drinks himself from the hand of the other; and if they have no liquid  they take of the dust from the ground and lick it.,mashup

These have perished utterly in the following manner:— The South Wind blowing upon them dried up all their cisterns of water  and their land was waterless  lying all within the Syrtis. They then having taken a resolve by common consent  marched in arms against the South Wind (I report that which is reported by the Libyans )  and when they had arrived at the sandy tract  the South Wind blew and buried them in the sand.

Through their land the river Kinyps runs out into the sea  flowing from a hill called theHill of the Charites. This Hill of the Charites is overgrown thickly with wood  while the rest of Libya which has been spoken of before is bare of trees; and the distance from the sea to this hill is two hundred furlongs.,mashup

In a peninsula which stands out into the sea from the land of these Gindanes dwell the Lotophagoi  who live by eating the fruit of the  lotos  only.

The following moreover is also told  namely that Jason  when the Argo had been completed by him under Mount Pelion  put into it a hecatomb and with it also a tripod of bronze  and sailed round Pelopponese  desiring to come to Delphi; and when in sailing he got near Malea  a North Wind seized his ship and carried it off to Libya  and before he caught sight of land he had come to be in the shoals of the lake Tritonis. Then as he was at a loss how he should bring his ship forth  the story goes that Triton appeared to him and bade Jason give him the tripod  saying that he would show them the right course and let them go away without hurt: and when Jason consented to it  then Triton showed them the passage out between the shoals and set the tripod in his own temple  after having first uttered a prophecy over the tripod and having declared to Jason and his company the whole matter  namely that whensoever one of the descendants of those who sailed with him in the Argo should carry away this tripod  then it was determined by fate that a hundred cities of Hellenes should be established about the lake Tritonis. Having heard this the native Libyans concealed the tripod.,mashup

These and the Machlyans dwell round the lake Tritonis  and the river Triton is the boundary between them: and while the Machlyans grow their hair long at the back of the head  the Auseans do so in front. At a yearly festival of Athene their maidens take their stand in two parties and fight against one another with stones and staves  and they say that in doing so they are fulfilling the rites handed down by their fathers for the divinity who was sprung from that land  whom we call Athene: and those of the maidens who die of the wounds received they callfalse-maidens. But before they let them begin the fight they do this:— all join together and equip the maiden who is judged to be the fairest on each occasion  with a Corinthian helmet and with full Hellenic armour  and then causing her to go up into a chariot they conduct her round the lake. Now I cannot tell with what they equipped the maidens in old time  before the Hellenes were settled near them; but I suppose that they used to be equipped with Egyptian armour  for it is from Egypt that both the shield and the helmet have come to the Hellenes  as I affirm. They say moreover that Athene is the daughter of Poseidon and of the lake Tritonis  and that she had some cause of complaint against her father and therefore gave herself to Zeus  and Zeus made her his own daughter. Such is the story which these tell; and they have their intercourse with women in common  not marrying but having intercourse like cattle: and when the child of any woman has grown big  he is brought before a meeting of the men held within three months of that time  and whomsoever of the men the child resembles  his son he is accounted to be.,mashup

Thus then have been mentioned those nomad Libyans who live along the sea-coast: and above these inland is the region of Libya which has wild beasts; and above the wild-beast region there stretches a raised belt of sand  extending from Thebes of the Egyptians to the Pillars of Heracles. In this belt at intervals of about ten days' journey there are fragments of salt in great lumps forming hills  and at the top of each hill there shoots up from the middle of the salt a spring of water cold and sweet; and about the spring dwell men  at the furthest limit towards the desert  and above the wild-beast region. First  at a distance of ten days' journey from Thebes  are the Ammonians  whose temple is derived from that of the Theban Zeus  for the image of Zeus in Thebes also  as I have said before  has the head of a ram. These  as it chances  have also other water of a spring  which in the early morning is warm; at the time when the market fills  cooler; when midday comes  it is quite cold  and then they water their gardens; but as the day declines  it abates from its coldness  until at last  when the sun sets  the water is warm; and it continues to increase in heat still more until it reaches midnight  when it boils and throws up bubbles; and when midnight passes  it becomes cooler gradually till dawn of day. This spring is called the fountain of the Sun.,mashup

From Augila at a distance again of ten days' journey there is another hill of salt and spring of water and a great number of fruit-bearing date-palms  as there are also in the other places: and men dwell here who are called the Garmantians  a very great nation  who carry earth to lay over the salt and then sow crops. From this point is the shortest way to the Lotophagoi  for from these it is a journey of thirty days to the country of the Garmantians. Among them also are produced the cattle which feed backwards; and they feed backwards for this reason  because they have their horns bent down forwards  and therefore they walk backwards as they feed; for forwards they cannot go  because the horns run into the ground in front of them; but in nothing else do they differ from other cattle except in this and in the thickness and firmness to the touch of their hide. These Garamantians of whom I speak hunt theCave-dwelling Ethiopians with their four-horse chariots  for the Cave-dwelling Ethiopians are the swiftest of foot of all men about whom we hear report made: and the Cave-dwellers feed upon serpents and lizards and such creeping things  and they use a language which resembles no other  for in it they squeak just like bats.,mashup

From the Garmantians at a distance again of ten days' journey there is another hill of salt and spring of water  and men dwell round it called Atarantians  who alone of all men about whom we know are nameless; for while all taken together have the name Atarantians  each separate man of them has no name given to him. These utter curses against the Sun when he is at his height  and moreover revile him with all manner of foul terms  because he oppresses them by his burning heat  both themselves and their land. After this at a distance of ten days' journey there is another hill of salt and spring of water  and men dwell round it. Near this salt hill is a mountain named Atlas  which is small in circuit and rounded on every side; and so exceedingly lofty is it said to be  that it is not possible to see its summits  for clouds never leave them either in the summer or in the winter. This the natives say is the pillar of the heaven. After this mountain these men got their name  for they are called Atlantians; and it is said that they neither eat anything that has life nor have any dreams.,mashup

However  the belt extends as far as the Pillars of Heracles and also in the parts outside them: and there is a mine of salt in it at a distance of ten days' journey from the Atlantians  and men dwelling there; and these all have their houses built of the lumps of salt  since these parts of Libya which we have now reached are without rain; for if it rained  the walls being made of salt would not be able to last: and the salt is dug up there both white and purple in colour.

Thus it is with these matters: but in the region to the West of lake Tritonis the Libyans cease to be nomads  and they do not practise the same customs  nor do to their children anything like that which the nomads are wont to do; for the nomad Libyans  whether all of them I cannot say for certain  but many of them  do as follows:— when their children are four years old  they burn with a greasy piece of sheep's wool the veins in the crowns of their heads  and some of them burn the veins of the temples  so that for all their lives to come the cold humour may not run down from their heads and do them hurt: and for this reason it is (they say ) that they are so healthy; for the Libyans are in truth the most healthy of all races concerning which we have knowledge  whether for this reason or not I cannot say for certain  but the most healthy they certainly are: and if  when they burn the children  a convulsion comes on  they have found out a remedy for this; for they pour upon them the water of a he-goat and so save them. I report that which is reported by the Libyans themselves.,mashup

Moreover the name too declares that the dress of the figures of Pallas has come from Libya  for the Libyan women wear over their other garments bare goat-skins (/aigeas/ ) with tasselled fringes and coloured over with red madder  and from the name of these goat-skins the Hellenes formed the name  aigis. I think also that in these regions first arose the practice of crying aloud during the performance of sacred rites  for the Libyan women do this very well. The Hellenes learnt from the Libyans also the yoking together of four horses.,mashup

On the West of the river Triton next after the Auseans come Libyans who are tillers of the soil  and whose custom it is to possess fixed habitations; and they are called Maxyans. They grow their hair long on the right side of their heads and cut it short upon the left  and smear their bodies over with red ochre. These say that they are of the men who came from Troy. This country and the rest of Libya which is towards the West is both much more frequented by wild beasts and much more thickly wooded than the country of the nomads: for whereas the part of Libya which is situated towards the East  where the nomads dwell  is low-lying and sandy up to the river Triton  that which succeeds it towards the West  the country of those who till the soil  is exceedingly mountainous and thickly-wooded and full of wild beasts: for in the land of these are found both the monstrous serpent and the lion and the elephant  and bears and venomous snakes and horned asses  besides the dog-headed men  and the headless men with their eyes set in their breasts (at least so say the Libyans about them )  and the wild men and wild women  and a great multitude of other beasts which are not fabulous like these.,mashup

In the land of the nomads however there exist none of these  but other animals as follows:— white-rump antelopes  gazelles  buffaloes  asses  not the horned kind but others which go without water (for in fact these never drink )  oryes  whose horns are made into the sides of the Phenician lyre (this animal is in size about equal to an ox )  small foxes  hyenas  porcupines  wild rams  wolves  jackals  panthers  boryes  land-crocodiles about three cubits in length and very much resembling lizards  ostriches  and small snakes  each with one horn: these wild animals there are in this country  as well as those which exist elsewhere  except the stag and the wild-boar; but Libya has no stags nor wild boars at all. Also there are in this country three kinds of mice  one is called thetwo- legged mouse  another the  zegeris  (a name which is Libyan and signifies in the Hellenic tongue ahill )  and a third theprickly mouse. There are also weasels produced in the  silphion  which are very like those of Tartessos.

Opposite these  as the Carthaginians say  there lies an island called Kyrauis  two hundred furlongs in length but narrow  to which one may walk over from the mainland; and it is full of olives and vines. In it they say there is a pool  from which the native girls with birds' feathers smeared over with pitch bring up gold-dust out of the mud. Whether this is really so I do not know  but I write that which is reported; and nothing is impossible  for even in Zakynthos I saw myself pitch brought up out of a pool of water. There are there several pools  and the largest of them measures seventy feet each way and is two fathoms in depth. Into this they plunge a pole with a myrtle-branch bound to it  and then with the branch of the myrtle they bring up pitch  which has the smell of asphalt  but in other respects it is superior to the pitch of Pieria. This they pour into a pit dug near the pool; and when they have collected a large quantity  then they pour it into the jars from the pit: and whatever thing falls into the pool goes under ground and reappears in the sea  which is distant about four furlongs from the pool. Thus then the report about the island lying near the coast of Libya is also probably enough true.,mashup

The Carthaginians say also this  namely that there is a place in Libya and men dwelling there  outside the Pillars of Heracles  to whom when they have come and have taken the merchandise forth from their ships  they set it in order along the beach and embark again in their ships  and after that they raise a smoke; and the natives of the country seeing the smoke come to the sea  and then they lay down gold as an equivalent for the merchandise and retire to a distance away from the merchandise. The Carthaginians upon that disembark and examine it  and if the gold is in their opinion sufficient for the value of the merchandise  they take it up and go their way; but if not  they embark again in their ships and sit there; and the others approach and straightway add more gold to the former  until they satisfy them: and they say that neither party wrongs the other; for neither do the Carthaginians lay hands on the gold until it is made equal to the value of their merchandise  nor do the others lay hands on the merchandise until the Carthaginians have taken the gold.,mashup

I think moreover that (besides other things ) in goodness of soil Libya does not very greatly excel as compared with Asia or Europe  except only the region of Kinyps  for the same name is given to the land as to the river. This region is equal to the best of lands in bringing forth the fruit of Demeter  nor does it at all resemble the rest of Libya; for it has black soil and is watered by springs  and neither has it fear of drought nor is it hurt by drinking too abundantly of rain; for rain there is in this part of Libya. Of the produce of the crops the same measures hold good here as for the Babylonian land. And that is good land also which the Euesperites occupy  for when it bears best it produces a hundred-fold  but the land in the region of Kinyps produces sometimes as much as three- hundred-fold.,mashup

Thus the harvest for the Kyrenians lasts eight months. Let so much as has been said suffice for these things.,mashup

Now when the Persian helpers of Pheretime  having been sent from Egypt by Aryandes  had arrived at Barca  they laid siege to the city  proposing to the inhabitants that they should give up those who were guilty of the murder of Arkesilaos: but as all their people had taken a share in the guilt  they did not accept the proposals. Then they besieged Barca for nine months  both digging underground passages which led to the wall and making vigorous attacks upon it. Now the passages dug were discovered by a worker of bronze with a shield covered over with bronze  who had thought of a plan as follows:— carrying it round within the wall he applied it to the ground in the city  and whereas the other places to which he applied it were noiseless  at those places where digging was going on the bronze of the shield gave a sound; and the men of Barca would make a countermine there and slay the Persians who were digging mines. This then was discovered as I have said  and the attacks were repulsed by the men of Barca.,mashup

Then as they were suffering hardship for a long time and many were falling on both sides  and especially on that of the Persians  Amasis the commander of the land-army contrived as follows:— perceiving that the Barcaians were not to be conquered by force but might be conquered by guile  he dug by night a broad trench and over it he laid timber of no great strength  and brought earth and laid it above on the top of the timber  making it level with the rest of the ground: then at daybreak he invited the men of Barca to a parley; and they gladly consented  and at last they agreed to make a treaty: and the treaty they made with one another was taken over the hidden trench  namely that so long as this earth should continue to be as it was  so long the oath should remain firm  and that the men of Barca should promise to pay tribute of due amount to the king  and the Persians should do no further violence to the men of Barca. After the oath the men of Barca trusting to these engagements both went forth themselves from their city and let any who desired it of the enemy pass within their walls  having opened all the gates; but the Persians first broke down the concealed bridge and then began to run inside the city wall. And the reason why they broke down the bridge which they had made was that they might keep their goats  since they had sworn to the men of Barca that the oath should remain firm continually for so long time as the earth should remain as it then was  but after that they had broken it down  the oath no longer remained firm.,mashup

Now the most guilty of the Barcaians  when they were delivered to her by the Persians  Pheretime impaled in a ring round about the wall; and she cut off the breasts of their wives and set the wall round with these also in order: but the rest of the men of Barca she bade the Persians carry off as spoil  except so many of them as were of the house of Battos and not sharers in the guilt of the murder; and to these Pheretime gave the city in charge.,mashup

So the Persians having made slaves of the rest of the Barcaians departed to go back: and when they appeared at the gates of the city of Kyrene  the Kyrenians let them go through their town in order to avoid neglect of some oracle. Then as the army was going through  Badres the commander of the fleet urged that they should capture the city  but Amasis the commander of the land-army would not consent to it; for he said that they had been sent against no other city of the Hellenes except Barca. When however they had passed through and were encamping on the hill of Zeus Lycaios  they repented of not having taken possession of Kyrene; and they endeavoured again to pass into it  but the men of Kyrene would not allow them. Then upon the Persians  although no one fought against them  there fell a sudden panic  and they ran away for about sixty furlongs and then encamped. And when the camp had been placed here  there came to it a messenger from Aryandes summoning them back; so the Persians asked the Kyrenians to give them provisions for their march and obtained their request; and having received these  they departed to go to Egypt. After this the Libyans took them up  and killed for the sake of their clothes and equipment those of them who at any time were left or straggled behind  until at last they came to Egypt.,mashup

To this village they gave the name of Barca  and it still continued to be inhabited by them even down to my own time  in the land of Bactria.,mashup

In the meantime those of the Persians who had been left behind in Europe by Dareios  of whom Megabazos was the commander  had subdued the people of Perinthos first of the Hellespontians  since they refused to be subject to Dareios. These had in former times also been hardly dealt with by the Paionians: for the Paionians from the Strymon had been commanded by an oracle of their god to march against the Perinthians; and if the Perinthians  when encamped opposite to them  should shout aloud and call to them by their name  they were to attack them; but if they should not shout to them  they were not to attack them: and thus the Paionians proceeded to do. Now when the Perinthians were encamped opposite to them in the suburb of their city  a challenge was made and a single combat took place in three different forms; for they matched a man against a man  and a horse against a horse  and a dog against a dog. Then  as the Perinthians were getting the better in two of the three  in their exultation they raised a shout of  paion  and the Paionians conjectured that this was the very thing which was spoken of in the oracle  and said doubtless to one another Now surely the oracle is being accomplished for us  now it is time for us to act. So the Paionians attacked the Perinthians when they had raised the shout of paion  and they had much the better in the fight  and left but few of them alive.,mashup

To be pricked with figures is accounted a mark of noble rank  and not to be so marked is a sign of low birth.

Of the region lying further on towards the North of this country no one can declare accurately who the men are who dwell in it; but the parts which lie immediately beyond the Ister are known to be uninhabited and vast in extent. The only men of whom I can hear who dwell beyond the Ister are those who are said to be called Sigynnai  and who use the Median fashion of dress. Their horses  it is said  have shaggy hair all over their bodies  as much as five fingers long; and these are small and flat-nosed and too weak to carry men  but when yoked in chariots they are very high-spirited; therefore the natives of the country drive chariots. The boundaries of this people extend  it is said  to the parts near the Enetoi  who live on the Adriatic; and people say that they are colonists from the Medes. In what way however these have come to be colonists from the Medes I am not able for my part to conceive  but everything is possible in the long course of ages. However that may be  the Ligurians who dwell in the region inland above Massalia call traders  sigynnai  and the men of Cyprus give the same name to spears.,mashup

These then are the tales reported about this country; and however that may be  Megabazos was then making the coast-regions of it subject to the Persians.,mashup

Histiaios then  being despot of Miletos  did not make request for any government in addition to that  but he asked for the district of Myrkinos which belonged to the Edonians  desiring there to found a city. Histiaios chose this for himself; but Coës  not being a despot but a man of the people  asked to be made despot of Mitylene.,mashup

After the desires of both had been fulfilled  they betook themselves to that which they had chosen: and at this same time it chanced that Dareios saw a certain thing which made him desire to command Megabazos to conquer the Paionians and remove them forcibly from Europe into Asia: and the thing was this:— There were certain Paionians named Pigres and Mantyas  who when Dareios had crossed over into Asia  came to Sardis  because they desired themselves to have rule over the Paionians  and with them they brought their sister  who was tall and comely. Then having watched for a time when Dareios took his seat publicly in the suburb of the Lydian city  they dressed up their sister in the best way they could  and sent her to fetch water  having a water-jar upon her head and leading a horse after her by a bridle round her arm  and at the same time spinning flax. Now when the woman passed out of the city by him  Dareios paid attention to the matter  for that which was done by the woman was not of Persian nor yet of Lydian fashion  nor indeed after the manner of any people of Asia. He sent therefore some of his spearmen  bidding them watch what the woman would do with the horse. They accordingly followed after her; and she having arrived at the river watered the horse  and having watered him and filled her jar with the water  she passed along by the same way  bearing the water upon her head  leading the horse after her by a bridle round her arm  and at the same time turning the spindle.,mashup

Then Dareios  marvelling both at that which he heard from those who went to observe and also at that which he saw himself  bade them bring her into his presence: and when she was brought  her brothers also came  who had been watching these things at no great distance off. So then when Dareios asked of what country she was  the young men said that they were Paionians and that she was their sister; and he replied:Who then are these Paionians  and where upon the earth do they dwell ? and he asked them also what they desired  that they had come to Sardis. They declared to him that they had come to give themselves up to him  and that Paionia was a country situated upon the river Strymon  and that the Strymon was not far from the Hellespont  and finally that they were colonists from the Teucrians of Troy. All these things severally they told him; and he asked whether all the women of that land were as industrious as their sister; and they very readily replied to this also  saying that it was so  for it was with a view to that very thing that they had been doing this.,mashup

The Paionians then were prepared  as I say  to drive off the army of Megabazos when it came against them; but the Persians hearing that the Paionians had gathered their powers and were guarding the entrance which lay towards the sea  directed their course with guides along the upper road; and passing unperceived by the Paionians they fell upon their cities  which were left without men  and finding them without defenders they easily took possession of them. The Paionians when they heard that their cities were in the hands of the enemy  at once dispersed  each tribe to its own place of abode  and proceeded to deliver themselves up to the Persians.

He tried however to remove even those who lived in the lake and who had their dwellings in the following manner:— a platform fastened together and resting upon lofty piles stood in the middle of the water of the lake  with a narrow approach to it from the mainland by a single bridge. The piles which supported the platform were no doubt originally set there by all the members of the community working together  but since that time they continue to set them by observance of this rule  that is to say  every man who marries brings from the mountain called Orbelos three piles for each wife and sets them as supports; and each man takes to himself many wives. And they have their dwelling thus  that is each man has possession of a hut upon the platform in which he lives and of a trap-door leading through the platform down to the lake: and their infant children they tie with a rope by the foot  for fear that they should roll into the water. To their horses and beasts of burden they give fish for fodder; and of fish there is so great quantity that if a man open the trap-door and let down an empty basket by a cord into the lake  after waiting quite a short time he draws it up again full of fish. Of the fish there are two kinds  and they call them  paprax  and  tilon.,mashup

These were being sent to Amyntas to demand of him earth and water for Dareios the king.

These Persians then  who had been sent to Amyntas  having arrived came into the presence of Amyntas and proceeded to demand earth and water for king Dareios. This he was willing to give  and also he invited them to be his guests; and he prepared a magnificent dinner and received the Persians with friendly hospitality. Then when dinner was over  the Persians while drinking pledges to one another said thus:Macedonian guest-friend  it is the custom among us Persians  when we set forth a great dinner  then to bring in also our concubines and lawful wives to sit beside us. Do thou then  since thou didst readily receive us and dost now entertain us magnificently as thy guests  and since thou art willing to give to king Dareios earth and water  consent to follow our custom. To this Amyntas replied:Persians  among us the custom is not so  but that men should be separate from women. Since however ye being our masters make this request in addition  this also shall be given you. Having so said Amyntas proceeded to send for the women; and when they came being summoned  they sat down in order opposite to the Persians. Then the Persians  seeing women of comely form  spoke to Amyntas and said that this which had been done was by no means well devised; for it was better that the women should not come at all  than that they should come and should not seat themselves by their side  but sit opposite and be a pain to their eyes. So Amyntas being compelled bade them sit by the side of the Persians; and when the women obeyed  forthwith the Persians  being much intoxicated  began to touch their breasts  and some no doubt also tried to kiss them.,mashup

When Amyntas after having made of him this request had departed  Alexander said to the Persians:With these women ye have perfect freedom  guests  to have commerce with all  if ye so desire  or with as many of them as ye will. About this matter ye shall be they who give the word; but now  since already the hour is approaching for you to go to bed and I see that ye have well drunk  let these women go away  if so it is pleasing to you  to bathe themselves; and when they have bathed  then receive them back into your company. Having so said  since the Persians readily agreed  he dismissed the women  when they had gone out  to the women's chambers; and Alexander himself equipped men equal in number to the women and smooth-faced  in the dress of the women  and giving them daggers he led them into the banqueting-room; and as he led them in  he said thus to the Persians:Persians  it seems to me that ye have been entertained with a feast to which nothing was wanting; for other things  as many as we had  and moreover such as we were able to find out and furnish  are all supplied to you  and there is this especially besides  which is the chief thing of all  that is  we give you freely in addition our mothers and our sisters  in order that ye may perceive fully that ye are honoured by us with that treatment which ye deserve  and also in order that ye may report to the king who sent you that a man of Hellas  ruler under him of the Macedonians  entertained you well at board and bed. Having thus said Alexander caused a Macedonian man in the guise of a woman to sit by each Persian  and they  when the Persians attempted to lay hands on them  slew them.,mashup

So these perished by this fate  both they themselves and their company of servants; for there came with them carriages and servants and all the usual pomp of equipage  and this was all made away with at the same time as they. Afterwards in no long time a great search was made by the Persians for these men  and Alexander stopped them with cunning by giving large sums of money and his own sister  whose name was Gygaia;— by giving  I say  these things to Bubares a Persian  commander of those who were searching for the men who had been killed  Alexander stopped their search.,mashup

And that these descendants of Perdiccas are Hellenes  as they themselves say  I happen to know myself  and not only so  but I will prove in the succeeding history that they are Hellenes. Moreover the Hellanodicai  who manage the games at Olympia  decided that they were so: for when Alexander wished to contend in the games and had descended for this purpose into the arena  the Hellenes who were to run against him tried to exclude him  saying that the contest was not for Barbarians to contend in but for Hellenes: since however Alexander proved that he was of Argos  he was judged to be a Hellene  and when he entered the contest of the foot-race his lot came out with that of the first.,mashup

Thus then it happened with regard to these things: and at the same time Megabazos had arrived at the Hellespont bringing with him the Paionians; and thence after passing over the straits he came to Sardis. Then  since Histiaios the Milesian was already engaged in fortifying with a wall the place which he had asked and obtained from Dareios as a reward for keeping safe the bridge of boats (this place being that which is called Myrkinos  lying along the bank of the river Strymon )  Megabazos  having perceived that which was being done by Histiaios  as soon as he came to Sardis bringing the Paionians  said thus to Dareios:O king  what a thing is this that thou hast done  granting permission to a Hellene who is skilful and cunning to found a city in Thracia in a place where there is forest for shipbuilding in abundance and great quantity of wood for oars and mines of silver and great numbers both of Hellenes and Barbarians living round  who when they have obtained a leader will do that which he shall command them both by day and by night. Therefore stop this man from doing so  that thou be not involved in a domestic war: and stop him by sending for him in a courteous manner; but when thou hast got him in thy hands  then cause that he shall never again return to the land of the Hellenes.,mashup

Now therefore  since I have it in my mind to accomplish great matters  come hither to me by all means  that I may communicate them to thee. Histiaios therefore  trusting to these sayings and at the same time accounting it a great thing to become a counsellor of the king  came to Sardis; and when he had come Dareios spoke to him as follows:Histiaios  I sent for thee for this reason  namely because when I had returned from the Scythians and thou wert gone away out of the sight of my eyes  never did I desire to see anything again within so short a time as I desired then both to see thee and that thou shouldst come to speech with me; since I perceived that the most valuable of all possessions is a friend who is a man of understanding and also sincerely well-disposed  both which qualities I know exist in thee  and I am able to bear witness of them in regard to my affairs. Now therefore (for thou didst well in that thou camest hither ) this is that which I propose to thee:— leave Miletos alone and also thy newly- founded city in Thracia  and coming with me to Susa  have whatsoever things I have  eating at my table and being my counseller.,mashup

Thus said Dareios  and having appointed Artaphrenes his own brother and the son of his father to be governor of Sardis  he marched away to Susa taking with him Histiaios  after he had first named Otanes to be commander of those who dwelt along the sea coasts. This man's father Sisamnes  who had been made one of the Royal Judges  king Cambyses slew  because he had judged a cause unjustly for money  and flayed off all his skin: then after he had torn away the skin he cut leathern thongs out of it and stretched them across the seat where Sisamnes had been wont to sit to give judgment; and having stretched them in the seat  Cambyses appointed the son of that Sisamnes whom he had slain and flayed  to be judge instead of his father  enjoining him to remember in what seat he was sitting to give judgment.,mashup

Of these the Lemnians fought well  and defending themselves for a long time were at length brought to ruin; and over those of them who survived the Persians set as governor Lycaretos the brother of that Maiandrios who had been king of Samos.

And the cause of it was this:— he continued to reduce all to slavery and subdue them  accusing some of desertion to the Scythians and others of doing damage to the army of Dareios as it was coming back from Scythia.,mashup

Otanes then effected so much when he was made commander: and after this for a short time there was an abatement of evils; and then again evils began a second time to fall upon the Ionians  arising from Naxos and Miletos. For Naxos was superior to all the other islands in wealth  and Miletos at the same time had just then come to the very height of its prosperity and was the ornament of Ionia; but before these events for two generations of men it had been afflicted most violently by faction until the Parians reformed it; for these the Milesians chose of all the Hellenes to be reformers of their State.,mashup

Then when they had passed through the whole land and had found but few of such men  as soon as they returned to the city they called a general gathering and appointed these men to manage the State  whose fields they had found well cultivated; for they said that they thought these men would take care of the public affairs as they had taken care of their own: and the rest of the Milesians  who before had been divided by factions  they commanded to be obedient to these men.,mashup

The Parians then had thus reformed the Milesians; but at the time of which I speak evils began to come to Ionia from these States in the following manner:— From Naxos certain men of the wealthier class were driven into exile by the people  and having gone into exile they arrived at Miletos. Now of Miletos it happened that Aristagoras son of Molpagoras was ruler in charge  being both a son- in-law and also a cousin of Histiaios the son of Lysagoras  whom Dareios was keeping at Susa: for Histiaios was despot of Miletos  and it happened that he was at Susa at this time when the Naxians came  who had been in former times guest-friends of Histiaios. So when the Naxians arrived  they made request of Aristagoras  to see if perchance he would supply them with a force  and so they might return from exile to their own land: and he  thinking that if by his means they should return to their own State  he would be ruler of Naxos  but at the same time making a pretext of the guest-friendship of Histiaios  made proposal to them thus:I am not able to engage that I can supply you with sufficient force to bring you back from exile against the will of those Naxians who have control of the State; for I hear that the Naxians have an army which is eight thousand shields strong and many ships of war: but I will use every endeavour to devise a means; and my plan is this:— it chances that Artaphrenes is my friend: now Artaphrenes  ye must know  is a son of Hystaspes and brother of Dareios the king; and he is ruler of all the people of the sea-coasts in Asia  with a great army and many ships. This man then I think will do whatsoever we shall request of him. Hearing this the Naxians gave over the matter to Aristagoras to manage as best he could  and they bade him promise gifts and the expenses of the expedition  saying that they would pay them; for they had full expectation that when they should appear at Naxos  the Naxians would do all their bidding  and likewise also the other islanders. For of these islands  that is the Cyclades  not one was as yet subject to Dareios.,mashup

Aristagoras accordingly having arrived at Sardis  said to Artaphrenes that Naxos was an island not indeed large in size  but fair nevertheless and of fertile soil  as well as near to Ionia  and that there was in it much wealth and many slaves:Do thou therefore send an expedition against this land  and restore it to those who are now exiles from it: and if thou shalt do this  first I have ready for thee large sums of money apart from the expenses incurred for the expedition (which it is fair that we who conduct it should supply )  and next thou wilt gain for the king not only Naxos itself but also the islands which are dependent upon it  Paros and Andros and the others which are called Cyclades; and setting out from these thou wilt easily attack Euboea  an island which is large and wealth  as large indeed as Cyprus  and very easy to conquer. To subdue all these a hundred ships are sufficient. He made answer in these words:Thou makest thyself a reporter of good things to the house of the king; and in all these things thou advisest well  except as to the number of the ships: for instead of one hundred there shall be prepared for thee two hundred by the beginning of the spring. And it is right that the king himself also should join in approving this matter.,mashup

So Aristagoras hearing this went back to Miletos greatly rejoiced; and Artaphrenes meanwhile  when he had sent to Susa and communicated that which was said by Aristagoras  and Dareios himself also had joined in approving it  made ready two hundred triremes and a very great multitude both of Persians and their allies  and appointed to be commander of these Megabates a Persian  one of the Achaimenidai and a cousin to himself and to Dareios  to whose daughter afterwards Pausanias the son of Cleombrotus the Lacedaemonian (at least if the story be true ) betrothed himself  having formed a desire to become a despot of Hellas. Having appointed Megabates  I say  to be commander  Artaphrenes sent away the armament to Aristagoras.,mashup

So when Megabates had taken force together with the Naxians  he sailed with the pretence of going to the Hellespont; but when he came to Chios  he directed his ships to Caucasa  in order that he might from thence pass them over to Naxos with a North Wind. Then  since it was not fated that the Naxians should be destroyed by this expedition  there happened an event which I shall narrate. As Megabates was going round to visit the guards set in the several ships  it chanced that in a ship of Myndos there was no one on guard; and he being very angry bade his spearmen find out the commander of the ship  whose name was Skylax  and bind him in an oar-hole of his ship in such a manner that his head should be outside and his body within. When Skylax was thus bound  some one reported to Aristagoras that Megabates had bound his guest-friend of Myndos and was doing to him shameful outrage. He accordingly came and asked the Persian for his release  and as he did not obtain anything of that which he requested  he went himself and let him loose. Being informed of this Megabates was exceedingly angry and broke out in rage against Aristagoras; and he replied:What hast thou to do with these matters? Did not Artaphrenes send thee to obey me  and to sail whithersoever I should order? Why dost thou meddle with things which concern thee not ? Thus said Aristagoras; and the other being enraged at this  when night came on sent men in a ship to Naxos to declare to the Naxians all the danger that threatened them.,mashup

For the Naxians were not at all expecting that this expedition would be against them: but when they were informed of it  forthwith they brought within the wall the property which was in the fields  and provided for themselves food and drink as for a siege  and strengthened their wall. These then were making preparations as for war to come upon them; and the others meanwhile having passed their ships over from Chios to Naxos  found them well defended when they made their attack  and besieged them for four months. Then when the money which the Persians had brought with them had all been consumed by them  and not only that  but Aristagoras himself had spent much in addition  and the siege demanded ever more and more  they built walls for the Naxian exiles and departed to the mainland again with ill success.,mashup

And so Aristagoras was not able to fulfil his promise to Artaphrenes; and at the same time he was hard pressed by the demand made to him for the expenses of the expedition  and had fears because of the ill success of the armament and because he had become an enemy of Megabates; and he supposed that he would be deprived of his rule over Miletos. Having all these various fears he began to make plans of revolt: for it happened also that just at this time the man who had been marked upon the head had come from Hisiaios who was at Susa  signifying that Aristagoras should revolt from the king. For Histiaios  desiring to signify to Aristagoras that he should revolt  was not able to do it safely in any other way  because the roads were guarded  but shaved off the hair of the most faithful of his slaves  and having marked his head by pricking it  waited till the hair had grown again; and as soon as it was grown  he sent him away to Miletos  giving him no other charge but this  namely that when he should have arrived at Miletos he should bid Aristagoras shave his hair and look at his head: and the marks  as I have said before  signified revolt. This thing Histiaios was doing  because he was greatly vexed by being detained at Susa. He had great hopes then that if a revolt occurred he would be let go to the sea-coast; but if no change was made at Miletos he had no expectation of ever returning thither again.,mashup

Accordingly Hisiaios with this intention was sending the messenger; and it chanced that all these things happened to Aristagoras together at the same time. He took counsel therefore with his partisans  declaring to them both his own opinion and the message from Hisiaios; and while all the rest expressed an opinion to the same effect  urging him namely to make revolt  Hecataios the historian urged first that they should not undertake war with the king of the Persians  enumerating all the nations over whom Dareios was ruler  and his power: and when he did not succeed in persuading him  he counselled next that they should manage to make themselves masters of the sea. Now this  he continued  could not come to pass in any other way  so far as he could see  for he knew that the force of the Milesians was weak  but if the treasures should be taken which were in the temple at Branchidai  which Croesus the Lydian dedicated as offerings  he had great hopes that they might become masters of the sea; and by this means they would not only themselves have wealth at their disposal  but the enemy would not be able to carry the things off as plunder. Now these treasures were of great value  as I have shown in the first part of the history. This opinion did not prevail; but nevertheless it was resolved to make revolt  and that one of them should sail to Myus  to make the force which had returned from Naxos and was then there  and endeavour to seize the commanders who sailed in the ships.,mashup

So Iatragoras was sent for this purpose and seized by craft Oliatos the son of Ibanollis of Mylasa  and Histiaios the son of Tymnes of Termera  and Coës the son of Erxander  to whom Dareios had given Mytilene as a gift  and Aristagoras the son of Heracleides of Kyme  and many others; and then Aristagoras openly made revolt and devised all that he could to the hurt of Dareios. And first he pretended to resign the despotic power and give to Miletos equality  in order that the Milesians might be willing to revolt with him: then afterwards he proceeded to do this same thing in the rest of Ionia also; and some of the despots he drove out  but those whom he had taken from the ships which had sailed with him to Naxis  these he surrendered  because he desired to do a pleasure to their cities  delivering them over severally to that city from which each one came.,mashup

Now the men of Mitylene  so soon as they received Coës into their hands  brought him out and stoned him to death; but the men of Kyme let their despot go  and so also most of the others let them go. Thus then the despots were deposed in the various cities; and Aristagoras the Milesian  after having deposed the despots  bade each people appoint commanders in their several cities  and then himself set forth as an envoy to Lacedemon; for in truth it was necessary that he should find out some powerful alliance.,mashup

Now at Sparta Anaxandrides the son of Leon was no longer surviving as king  but had brought his life to an end; and Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides was holding the royal power  not having obtained it by merit but by right of birth. For Anaxandrides had to wife his own sister's daughter and she was by him much beloved  but no children were born to him by her. This being so  the Ephors summoned him before them and said:If thou dost not for thyself take thought in time  yet we cannot suffer this to happen  that the race of Eurysthenes should become extinct. Do thou therefore put away from thee the wife whom thou now hast  since  as thou knowest  she bears thee no children  and marry another: and in doing so thou wilt please the Spartans. He made answer saying that he would do neither of these two things  and that they did not give him honourable counsel  in that they advised him to send away the wife whom he had  though she had done him no wrong  and to take to his house another; and in short he would not follow their advice.,mashup

We do not ask of thee the putting away of the wife whom thou hast; but do thou give to her all that thou givest now and at the same time take to thy house another wife in addition to this one  to bear thee children.

Since then they made a great show of indignation  as the time was fast drawing near  the Ephors being incredulous sat round and watched the woman during the birth of her child: and she bore Dorieos and then straightway conceived Leonidas and after him at once Cleombrotos — nay  some even say that Cleombrotos and Leonidas were twins.

Now Cleomenes  it is said  was not quite in his right senses but on the verge of madness  while Dorieos was of all his equals in age the first  and felt assured that he would obtain the kingdom by merit. Seeing then that he had this opinion  when Anaxandrides died and the Lacedemonians followed the usual custom established the eldest  namely Cleomenes  upon the throne  Dorieos being indignant and not thinking it fit that he should be a subject of Cleomenes  asked the Spartans to give him a company of followers and led them out to found a colony  without either inquiring of the Oracle at Delphi to what land he should go to make a settlement  or doing any of the things which are usually done; but being vexed he sailed away with his ships to Libya  and the Theraians were his guides thither. Then having come to Kinyps he made a settlement in the fairest spot of all Libya  along the banks of the river; but afterwards in the third year he was driven out from thence by the Macai and the Libyans and the Carthaginians  and returned to Peloponnesus.,mashup

Then Antichares a man of Eleon gave him counsel out of the oracles of Laios to make a settlement at Heracleia in Sicily  saying that the whole land of Eryx belonged to the Heracleidai  since Heracles himself had won it: and hearing this he went forthwith to Delphi to inquire of the Oracle whether he would be able to conquer the land to which he was setting forth; and the Pythian prophetess replied to him that he would conquer it. Dorieos therefore took with him the armament which he conducted before to Libya  and voyaged along the coast of Italy.,mashup

Now at this time  the men of Sybaris say that they and their king Telys were about to make an expedition against Croton  and the men of Croton being exceedingly alarmed asked Dorieos to help them and obtained their request. So Dorieos joined them in an expedition against Sybaris and helped them to conquer Sybaris. This is what the men of Sybaris say of the doings of Dorieos and his followers; but those of Croton say that no stranger helped them in the war against the Sybarites except Callias alone  a diviner of Elis and one of the descendants of Iamos  and he in the following manner:— he ran away  they say  from Telys the despot of the Sybarites  when the sacrifices did not prove favourable  as he was sacrificing for the expedition against Croton  and so he came to them.,mashup

Such  I say  are the tales which these tell  and they severally produce as evidence of them the following facts:— the Sybarites point to a sacred enclosure and temple by the side of the dried-up bed of the Crathis  which they say that Dorieos  after he had joined in the capture of the city  set up to Athene surnamedof the Crathis; and besides they consider the death of Dorieos himself to be a very strong evidence  thinking that he perished because he acted contrary to the oracle which was given to him; for if he had not done anything by the way but had continued to do that for which he was sent  he would have conquered the land of Eryx and having conquered it would have become possessor of it  and he and his army would not have perished. On the other hand the men of Croton declare that many things were granted in the territory of Croton as special gifts to Callias the Eleisan  of which the descendants of Callias were still in possession down to my time  and that nothing was granted to Dorieos or the descendants of Dorieos: but if Dorieos had in fact helped them in the way with Sybaris  many times as much  they say  would have been given to him as to Callias. These then are the evidences which the two sides produce  and we may assent to whichever of them we think credible.,mashup

Now there sailed with Dorieos others also of the Spartans  to be joint-founders with him of the colony  namely Thessalos and Paraibates and Keleas and Euryleon; and these when they had reached Sicily with all their armament  were slain  being defeated in battle by the Phenicians and the men of Egesta; and Euryleon only of the joint-founders survived this disaster. This man then having collected the survivors of the expedition  took possession of Minoa the colony of Selinus  and he helped to free the men of Selinus from their despot Peithagoras. Afterwards  when he had deposed him  he laid hands himself upon the despotism in Selinus and became sole ruler there  though but for a short time; for the men of Selinus rose in revolt against him and slew him  notwithstanding that he had fled for refuge to the altar of Zeus Agoraios.,mashup

There had accompanied Dorieos also and died with him Philip the son of Butakides  a man of Croton  who having betrothed himself to the daughter of Telys the Sybarite  became an exile from Croton; and then being disappointed of this marriage he sailed away to Kyrene  whence he set forth and accompanied Dorieos with a trireme of his own  himself supplying the expenses of the crew. Now this man had been a victor at the Olympic games  and he was the most beautiful of the Hellenes who lived in his time; and on account of his beauty he obtained from the men of Egesta that which none else ever obtained from them  for they established a hero-temple over his tomb  and they propitiate him still with sacrifices.,mashup

However  Aristagoras the despot of Miletos arrived at Sparta while Cleomenes was reigning: and accordingly with him he came to speech  having  as the Lacedemonians say  a tablet of bronze  on which was engraved a map of the whole Earth  with all the sea and all the rivers. And when he came to speech with Cleomenes he said to him as follows:Marvel not  Cleomenes  at my earnestness in coming hither  for the case is this.— That the sons of the Ionians should be slaves instead of free is a reproach and a grief most of all indeed to ourselves  but of all others most to you  inasmuch as ye are the leaders of Hellas. Now therefore I entreat you by the gods of Hellas to rescue from slavery the Ionians  who are your own kinsmen: and ye may easily achieve this  for the Barbarians are not valiant in fight  whereas ye have attained to the highest point of valour in that which relates to war: and their fighting is of this fashion  namely with bows and arrows and a short spear  and they go into battle wearing trousers and with caps on their heads. Thus they are easily conquered. Then again they who occupy that continent have good things in such quantity as not all the other nations of the world together possess; first gold  then silver and bronze and embroidered garments and beasts of burden and slaves; all which ye might have for yourselves  if ye so desired. And the nations moreover dwell in such order one after the other as I shall declare:— the Ionians here; and next to them the Lydians  who not only dwell in a fertile land  but are also exceedingly rich in gold and silver — and as he said this he pointed to the map of the Earth  which he carried with him engraved upon the tablet —and here next to the Lydians  continued Aristagoras are the Eastern Phrygians  who have both the greatest number of sheep and cattle of any people that I know  and also the most abundant crops. Next to the Phrygians are the Cappadokians  whom we call Syrians; and bordering upon them are the Kilikians  coming down to this sea  in which lies the island of Cyprus here; and these pay five hundred talents to the king for their yearly tribute. Next to these Kilikians are the Armenians  whom thou mayest see here  and these also have great numbers of sheep and cattle. Next to the Armenians are the Matienians occupying this country here; and next to them is the land of Kissia here  in which land by the banks of this river Choaspes is situated that city of Susa where the great king has his residence  and where the money is laid up in treasuries. After ye have taken this city ye may then with good courage enter into a contest with Zeus in the matter of wealth. Nay  but can it be that ye feel yourselves bound to take upon you the risk of battles against Messenians and Arcadians and Argives  who are equally matched against you  for the sake of land which is not much in extent nor very fertile  and for confines which are but small  though these peoples have neither gold nor silver at all  for the sake of which desire incites one to fight and to die — can this be  I say  and will ye choose some other way now  when it is possible for you easily to have the rule over all Asia ? Aristagoras spoke thus  and Cleomenes answered him saying:Guest-friend from Miletos  I defer my answer to thee until the day after to-morrow.,mashup

Thus far then they advanced at that time; and when the appointed day arrived for the answer  and they had come to the place agreed upon  Cleomenes asked Aristagoras how many days' journey it was from the sea of the Ionians to the residence of the king. Now Aristagoras  who in other respects acted cleverly and imposed upon him well  in this point made a mistake: for whereas he ought not to have told him the truth  at least if he desired to bring the Spartans out to Asia  he said in fact that it was a journey up from the sea of three months: and the other cutting short the rest of the account which Aristagoras had begun to give of the way  said:Guest-friend from Miletos  get thee away from Sparta before the sun has set; for thou speakest a word which sounds not well in the ears of the Lacedemonians  desiring to take them a journey of three months from the sea.,mashup

Cleomenes however bade him say that which he desired to say  and not to stop on account of the child. Then Aristagoras proceeded to promise him money  beginning with ten talents  if he would accomplish for him that for which he was asking; and when Cleomenes refused  Aristagoras went on increasing the sums of money offered  until at last he had promised fifty talents  and at that moment the child cried out:Father  the stranger will do thee hurt  if thou do not leave him and go. Cleomenes  then  pleased by the counsel of the child  departed into another room  and Aristagoras went away from Sparta altogether  and had no opportunity of explaining any further about the way up from the sea to the residence of the king.,mashup

As regards this road the truth is as follows.— Everywhere there are royal stages and excellent resting-places  and the whole road runs through country which is inhabited and safe. Through Lydia and Phrygia there extend twenty stages  amounting to ninety-four and a half leagues; and after Phrygia succeeds the river Halys  at which there is a gate which one must needs pass through in order to cross the river  and a strong guard-post is established there. Then after crossing over into Cappadokia it is twenty-eight stages  being a hundred and four leagues  by this way to the borders of Kilikia; and on the borders of the Kilikians you will pass through two several gates and go by two several guard-posts: then after passing through these it is three stages  amounting to fifteen and a half leagues  to journey through Kilikia; and the boundary of Kilikia and Armenia is a navigable river called Euphrates. In Armenia the number of stages with resting-places is fifteen  and of leagues fifty-six and a half  and there is a guard-post on the way: then from Armenia  when one enters the land of Matiene  there are thirty-four stages  amounting to a hundred and thirty-seven leagues; and through this land flow four navigable rivers  which cannot be crossed but by ferries  first the Tigris  then a second and third called both by the same name  though they are not the same river nor do they flow from the same region (for the first-mentioned of them flows from the Armenian land and the other from that of the Matienians )  and the fourth of the rivers is called Gyndes  the same which once Cyrus divided into three hundred and sixty channels. Passing thence into the Kissian land  there are eleven stages  forty-two and a half leagues  to the river Choaspes  which is also a navigable stream; and upon this is built the city of Susa. The number of these stages amounts in all to one hundred and eleven.,mashup

Thus the Milesian Aristagoras  when he told Cleomenes the Lacedemonian that the journey up from the sea to the residence of the king was one of three months  spoke correctly: but if any one demands a more exact statement yet than this  I will give him that also: for we ought to reckon in addition to this the length of the road from Ephesos to Sardis; and I say accordingly that the whole number of furlongs from the sea of Hellas to Susa (for by that name the city of Memnon is known ) is fourteen thousand and forty; for the number of furlongs from Ephesos to Sardis is five hundred and forty: thus the three months' journey is lengthened by three days added.,mashup

Aristagoras then being driven out of Sparta proceeded to Athens; which had been set free from the rule of despots in the way which I shall tell.— When Hipparchos the son of Peisistratos and brother of the despot Hippias  after seeing a vision of a dream which signified it to him plainly  had been slain by Aristogeiton and Harmodios  who were originally by descent Gephyraians  the Athenians continued for four years after this to be despotically governed no less than formerly — nay  even more.,mashup

Now the Gephyraians  of whom were those who murdered Hipparchos  according to their own account were originally descended from Eretria; but as I find by carrying inquiries back  they were Phenicians of those who came with Cadmos to the land which is now called Boeotia  and they dwelt in the district of Tanagra  which they had had allotted to them in that land. Then after the Cadmeians had first been driven out by the Argives  these Gephyraians next were driven out by the Boeotians and turned then towards Athens: and the Athenians received them on certain fixed conditions to be citizens of their State  laying down rules that they should be excluded from a number of things not worth mentioning here.,mashup

Now these Phenicians who came with Cadmos  of whom were the Gephyraians  brought in among the Hellenes many arts when they settled in this land of Boeotia  and especially letters  which did not exist  as it appears to me  among the Hellenes before this time; and at first they brought in those which are used by the Phenician race generally  but afterwards  as time went on  they changed with their speech the form of the letters also. During this time the Ionians were the race of Hellenes who dwelt near them in most of the places where they were; and these  having received letters by instruction of the Phenicians  changed their form slightly and so made use of them  and in doing so they declared them to be calledphenicians  as was just  seeing that the Phenicians had introduced them into Hellas. Also the Ionians from ancient time call paperskins  because formerly  paper being scarce  they used skins of goat and sheep; nay  even in my own time many of the Barbarians write on such skins.,mashup

I have told now of the vision of a dream seen by Hipparchos  and also whence the Gephrynians were descended  of which race were the murderers of Hipparchos; and in addition to this I must resume and continue the story which I was about to tell at first  how the Athenians were freed from despots. When Hippias was despot and was dealing harshly with the Athenians because of the death of Hipparchos  the Alcmaionidai  who were of Athenian race and were fugitives from the sons of Peisistratos  as they did not succeed in their attempt made together with the other Athenian exiles to return by force  but met with great disaster when they attempted to return and set Athens free  after they had fortified Leipsydrion which is above Paionia — these Alomaionidai after that  still devising every means against the sons of Peisistratos  accepted the contract to build and complete the temple at Delphi  that namely which now exists but then did not as yet: and being wealthy and men of repute already from ancient time  they completed the temple in a manner more beautiful than the plan required  and especially in this respect  that having agreed to make the temple of common limestone  they built the front parts of it in Parian marble.,mashup

So then  as the Athenians say  these men being settled at Delphi persuaded the Pythian prophetess by gifts of money  that whenever men of the Spartans should come to inquire of the Oracle  either privately or publicly sent  she should propose to them to set Athens free. The Lacedemonians therefore  since the same utterance was delivered to them on all occasions  sent Anchimolios the son of Aster  who was of repute among their citizens  with an army to drive out the sons of Peisistratos from Athens  although these were very closely connected with them by guest-friendship; for they held that the concerns of the god should be preferred to those of men: and this force they sent by sea in ships. He therefore  having put in to shore at Phaleron  disembarked his army; but the sons of Peisistratos being informed of this beforehand called in to their aid an auxiliary force from Thessaly  for they had made an alliance with the Thessalians; and the Thessalians at their request sent by public resolution a body of a thousand horse and also their king Kineas  a man of Conion. So having obtained these as allies  the sons of Peisistratos contrived as follows:— they cut down the trees in the plain of Phaleron and made this district fit for horsemen to ride over  and after that they sent the cavalry to attack the enemy's camp  who falling upon it slew (besides many others of the Lacedemonians ) Anchimolios himself also: and the survivors of them they shut up in their ships. Such was the issue of the first expedition from Lacedemon: and the burial-place of Anchimolios is at Alopecai in Attica  near the temple of Heracles which is at Kynosarges.,mashup

After this the Lacedemonians equipped a larger expedition and sent it forth against Athens; and they appointed to be commander of the army their king Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides  and sent it this time not by sea but by land. With these  when they had invaded the land of Attica  first the Thessalian horse engaged battle; and in no long time they were routed and there fell of them more than forty men; so the survivors departed without more ado and went straight back to Thessaly. Then Cleomenes came to the city together with those of the Athenians who desired to be free  and began to besiege the despots shut up in the Pelasgian wall.,mashup

And the Lacedemonians would never have captured the sons of Peisistratos at all; for they on their side had no design to make a long blockade  and the others were well provided with food and drink; so that they would have gone away back to Sparta after besieging them for a few days only: but as it was  a thing happened just at this time which was unfortunate for those  and at the same time of assistance to these; for the children of the sons of Peisistratos were captured  while being secretly removed out of the country: and when this happened  all their matters were thereby cast into confusion  and they surrendered receiving back their children on the terms which the Athenians desired  namely that they should depart out of Attica within five days. After this they departed out of the country and went to Sigeion on the Scamander  after their family had ruled over the Athenians for six-and-thirty years. These also were originally Pylians and sons of Neleus  descended from the same ancestors as the family of Codros and Melanthos  who had formerly become kings of Athens being settlers from abroad. Hence too Hippocrates had given to his son the name of Peisistratos as a memorial  calling him after Peisistratos the son of Nestor. Thus the Athenians were freed from despots; and the things worthy to be narrated which they did or suffered after they were liberated  up to the time when Ionia revolted from Dareios and Aristagoras the Milesian came to Athens and asked them to help him  these I will set forth first before I proceed further.,mashup

These men came to party strife for power; and then Cleisthenes was being worsted in the struggle  he made common cause with the people. After this he caused the Athenians to be in ten tribes  who were formerly in four; and he changed the names by which they were called after the sons of Ion  namely Geleon  Aigicoreus  Argades  and Hoples  and invented for them names taken from other heroes  all native Athenians except Ajax  whom he added as a neighbour and ally  although he was no Athenian.,mashup

Κλεισθένης δὲ χοροὺς μὲν τῷ Διονύσῳ ἀπέδωκε  τὴν δὲ ἄλλην θυσίην Μελανίππῳ. Now in these things it seems to me that this Cleisthenes was imitating his mother's father Cleisthenes the despot of Sikyon: for Cleisthenes when he went to war with Argos first caused to cease in Sikyon the contests of rhapsodists  which were concerned with the poems of Homer  because Argives and Argos are celebrated in them almost everywhere; then secondly  since there was (as still there is ) in the market-place itself of the Sikyonians a hero-temple of Adrastos the son of Talaos  Cleisthenes had a desire to cast him forth out of the land  because he was an Argive. So having come to Delphi he consulted the Oracle as to whether he should cast out Adrastos; and the Pythian prophetess answered him saying that Adrastos was king of the Sikyonians  whereas he was a stoner of them. So since the god did not permit him to do this  he went away home and considered means by which Adrastos should be brought to depart of his own accord: and when he thought that he had discovered them  he sent to Thebes in Boeotia and said that he desired to introduce into his city Melanippos the son of Astacos  and the Thebans gave him leave. So Cleisthenes introduced Melanippos into his city  and appointed for him a sacred enclosure within the precincts of the City Hall itself  and established him there in the strongest position. Now Cleisthenes introduced Melanippos (for I must relate this also ) because he was the greatest enemy of Adrastos  seeing that he had killed both his brother Mekisteus and his son-in-law Tydeus: and when he had appointed the sacred enclosure for him  he took away the sacrifices and festivals of Adrastos and gave them to Melanippos. Now the Sikyonians were accustomed to honour Adrastos with very great honours; for this land was formerly the land of Polybos  and Adrastos was daughter's son to Polybos  and Polybos dying without sons gave his kingdom to Adrastos: the Sikyonians then not only gave other honours to Adrastos  but also with reference to his sufferings they specially honoured him with tragic choruses  not paying the honour to Dionysos but to Adrastos. Cleisthenes however gave back the choruses to Dionysos  and the other rites besides this he gave to Melannipos.,mashup

Thus he had done to Adrastos; and he also changed the names of the Dorian tribes  in order that the Sikyonians might not have the same tribes as the Argives; in which matter he showed great contempt of the Sikyonians  for the names he gave were taken from the names of a pig and an ass by changing only the endings  except in the case of his own tribe  to which he gave a name from his own rule. These last then were called Archelaoi  while of the rest those of one tribe were called Hyatai  of another Oneatai  and of the remaining tribe Choireatai. These names of tribes were used by the men of Sikyon not only in the reign of Cleisthenes  but also beyond that for sixty years after his death; then however they considered the matter and changed them into Hylleis  Pamphyloi  and Dymanatai  adding to these a fourth  to which they gave the name Aigialeis after Aigialeus the son of Adrastos.,mashup

Then Isagoras  as he was being worsted in his turn  contrived a plan in opposition to him  that is to say  he called in Cleomenes the Lacedemonian to help him  who had been a guest-friend to himself since the siege of the sons of Peisistratos; moreover Cleomenes was accused of being intimate with the wife of Isagoras. First then Cleomenes sent a herald to Athens demanding the expulsion of Cleisthenes and with him many others of the Athenians  calling them the men who were under the curse: this message he sent by instruction of Isagoras  for the Alcmaionidai and their party were accused of the murder to which reference was thus made  while he and his friends had no part in it.,mashup

Now the men of the Athenians who wereunder the curse got this name as follows:— there was one Kylon among the Athenians  a man who had gained the victory at the Olympic games: this man behaved with arrogance  wishing to make himself despot; and having formed for himself an association of men of his own age  he endeavoured to seize the Acropolis: but not being able to get possession of it  he sat down as a suppliant before the image of the goddess. These men were taken from their place as suppliants by the presidents of the naucraries  who then administered affairs at Athens  on the condition that they should be liable to any penalty short of death; and the Alcmaionidai are accused of having put them to death.

Now when Cleomenes sent demanding the expulsion of Cleisthenes and of those under the curse  Cleisthenes himself retired secretly; but after that nevertheless Cleomenes appeared in Athens with no very large force  and having arrived he proceeded to expel as accursed seven hundred Athenian families  of which Isagoras had suggested to him the names. Having done this he next endeavoured to dissolve the Senate  and he put the offices of the State into the hands of three hundred  who were the partisans of Isagoras. The Senate however making opposition  and not being willing to submit  Cleomenes with Isagoras and his partisans seized the Acropolis. Then the rest of the Athenians joined together by common consent and besieged them for two days; and on the third day so many of them as were Lacedemonians departed out of the country under a truce. Thus was accomplished for Cleomenes the ominous saying which was uttered to him: for when he had ascended the Acropolis with the design of taking possession of it  he was going to the sanctuary of the goddess  as to address her in prayer; but the priestess stood up from her seat before he had passed through the door  and said Lacedemonian stranger  go back and enter not into the temple  for it is not lawful for Dorians to pass in hither. He said:Woman  I am not a Dorian  but an Achaian. So then  paying no attention to the ominous speech  he made his attempt and then was expelled again with the Lacedemonians; but the rest of the men the Athenians laid in bonds to be put to death  and among them Timesitheos the Delphian  with regard to whom I might mention very great deeds of strength and courage which he performed.,mashup

So when these envoys had arrived at Sardis and were saying that which they had been commanded to say  Artaphrenes the son of Hystaspes  the governor of Sardis  asked what men these were who requested to be allies of the Persians  and where upon the earth they dwelt; and having heard this from the envoys  he summed up his answer to them thus  saying that if the Athenians were willing to give earth and water to Dareios  he was willing to make alliance with them  but if not  he bade them begone: and the envoys taking the matter upon themselves said that they were willing to do so  because they desired to make the alliance.,mashup

Cleomenes then with a large army entered Eleusis  while at the same time the Boeotians by agreement with him captured Oinoe and Hysiai  the demes which lay upon the extreme borders of Attica  and the Chalkidians on the other side invaded and began to ravage various districts of Attica.

This army then having been ingloriously broken up  the Athenians after that  desiring to avenge themselves  made expedition first against the Chalkidians; and the Boeotians came to the Euripos to help the Chalkidians. The Athenians  therefore  seeing those who had come to help  resolved first to attack the Boeotians before the Chalkidians. Accordingly they engaged battle with the Boeotians  and had much the better of them  and after having slain very many they took seven hundred of them captive. On this very same day the Athenians passed over into Euboea and engaged battle with the Chalkidians as well; and having conquered these also  they left four thousand holders of allotments in the land belonging to theBreeders of Horses: now the wealthier of the Chalkidians were called the Breeders of Horses. And as many of them as they took captive  they kept in confinement together with the Boeotians who had been captured  bound with fetters; and then after a time they let them go  having fixed their ransom at two pounds of silver apiece: but their fetters  in which they had been bound  they hung up on the Acropolis; and these were still existing even to my time hanging on walls which had been scorched with fire by the Mede  and just opposite the sanctuary which lies towards the West. The tenth part of the ransom also they dedicated for an offering  and made of it a four-horse chariot of bronze  which stands on the left hand as you enter the Propylaia in the Acropolis  and on it is the following inscription:Matched in the deeds of war with the tribes of Boeotia and Chalkis The sons of Athens prevailed  conquered and tamed them in fight: In chains of iron and darkness they quenched their insolent spirit; And to Athene present these  of their ransom a tithe.,mashup

The Athenians accordingly increased in power; and it is evident  not by one instance only but in every way  that Equality is an excellent thing  since the Athenians while they were ruled by despots were not better in war that any of those who dwelt about them  whereas after they had got rid of despots they became far the first. This proves that when they were kept down they were wilfully slack  because they were working for a master  whereas when they had been set free each one was eager to achieve something for himself.,mashup

These then were faring thus: and the Thebans after this sent to the god  desiring to be avenged on the Athenians; the Pythian prophetess however said that vengeance was not possible for them by their own strength alone  but bade them report the matter to themany-voiced and ask help of those who werenearest to them. So when those who were sent to consult the Oracle returned  they made a general assembly and reported the oracle; and then the Thebans heard them say that they were to ask help of those who were nearest to them  they said:Surely those who dwell nearest to us are the men of Tanagra and Coroneia and Thespiai; and these always fight zealously on our side and endure the war with us to the end: what need is there that we ask of these? Rather perhaps that is not the meaning of the oracle.,mashup

While they commented upon it thus  at length one perceived that which the oracle means to tell us. Asopos is said to have had two daughters born to him  Thebe and Egina; and as these are sisters  I think that the god gave us for answer that we should ask the men of Egina to become our helpers. Then as there seemed to be no opinion expressed which was better than this  they sent forthwith and asked the men of Egina to help them  calling upon them in accordance with the oracle; and they  when these made request  said that they sent with them the sons of Aiacos to help them.,mashup

After that the Thebans  having made an attempt with the alliance of the sons of Aiacos and having been roughly handled by the Athenians  sent again and gave them back the sons of Aiacos and asked them for men. So the Eginetans  exalted by great prosperity and calling to mind an ancient grudge against the Athenians  then on the request of the Thebans commenced a war against the Athenians without notice: for while the Athenians were intent on the Boeotians  they sailed against them to Attica with ships of war  and they devastated Phaleron and also many demes in the remainder of the coast region  and so doing they deeply stirred the resentment of the Athenians.,mashup

Now the grudge which was due beforehand from the Eginetans to the Athenians came about from a beginning which was as follows:— The land of the Epidaurians yielded to its inhabitants no fruit; and accordingly with reference to this calamity the Epidaurians went to inquire at Delphi  and the Pythian prophetess bade them set up images of Damia and Auxesia  and said that when they had set up these  they would meet with better fortune. The Epidaurians then asked further whether they should make images of bronze or of stone; and the prophetess bade them not use either of these  but make them of the wood of a cultivated olive-tree. The Epidaurians therefore asked the Athenians to allow them to cut for themselves an olive-tree  since they thought that their olives were the most sacred; nay some say that at that time there were no olives in any part of the earth except at Athens. The Athenians said that they would allow them on condition that they should every year bring due offerings to Athene Polias and to Erechtheus. The Epidaurians  then  having agreed to these terms  obtained that which they asked  and they made images out of these olive-trees and set them up: and their land bore fruit and they continued to fulfil towards the Athenians that which they had agreed to do.,mashup

Now during this time and also before this the Eginetans were subject to the Epidaurians  and besides other things they were wont to pass over to Epidauros to have their disputes with one another settled by law: but after this time they built for themselves ships and made revolt from the Epidaurians  moved thereto by wilfulness. So as they were at variance with them  they continued to inflict damage on them  since in fact they had command of the sea  and especially they stole away from them these images of Damia and Auxesia  and they brought them and set them up in the inland part of their country at a place called Oia  which is about twenty furlongs distant from their city. Having set them up in this spot they worshipped them with sacrifices and choruses of women accompanied with scurrilous jesting  ten men being appointed for each of the deities to provide the choruses: and the choruses spoke evil of no man  but only of the women of the place. Now the Epidaurians also had the same rites; and they have also rites which may not be divulged.,mashup

The Athenians accordingly sent and expressed displeasure to the Epidaurians; and they declared saying that they were doing no wrong; for during the time when they had the images in their country they continued to fulfil that which they had agreed upon  but since they had been deprived of them  it was not just that they should make the offerings any more; and they bade them demand these from the men of Egina  who had the images. So the Athenians sent to Egina and demanded the images back; but the Eginetans said that they had nothing to do with the Athenians.,mashup

The Athenians then report that in one single trireme were despatched those of their citizens who were sent by the State after this demand; who having come to Egina  attempted to tear up from off their pedestals the images  (alleging that they were made of wood which belonged to the Athenians )  in order to carry them back with them: but not being able to get hold of them in this manner (say the Athenians ) they threw ropes round them and were pulling them  when suddenly  as they pulled  thunder came on and an earthquake at the same time with the thunder; and the crew of the trireme who were pulling were made beside themselves by these  and being brought to this condition they killed one another as if they were enemies  until at last but one of the whole number was left; and he returned alone to Phaleron.,mashup

Thus the Athenians report that it came to pass: but the Eginetans say that it was not with a single ship that the Athenians came; for a single ship  and even a few more than one  they could have easily repelled  even if they had not happened to have ships of their own: but they say that the Athenians sailed upon their country with a large fleet of ships  and they gave way before them and did not fight a sea-battle. They cannot however declare with certainty whether they gave way thus because they admitted that they were not strong enough to fight the battle by sea  or because they intended to do something of the kind which they actually did. The Athenians then  they say  as no one met them in fight  landed from their ships and made for the images; but not being able to tear them up from their pedestals  at last they threw ropes round them and began to pull  until the images  as they were being pulled  did both the same thing (and here they report something which I cannot believe  but some other man may )  for they say that the images fell upon their knees to them and that they continue to be in that position ever since this time. The Athenians  they say  were doing thus; and meanwhile they themselves (say the Eginetans )  being informed that the Athenians were about to make an expedition against them  got the Argives to help them; and just when the Athenians had disembarked upon the Eginetan land  the Argives had come to their rescue  and not having been perceived when they passed over from Epidauros to the island  they fell upon the Athenians before these had heard anything of the matter  cutting them off secretly from the way to their ships; and at this moment it was that the thunder and the earthquake came upon them.,mashup

This is the report which is given by the Argives and Eginetans both  and it is admitted by the Athenians also that but one alone of them survived and came back to Attica: only the Argives say that this one remained alive from destruction wrought by them upon the army of Athens  while the Athenians say that the divine power was the destroyer. However  even this one man did not remain alive  but perished  they say  in the following manner:— when he returned to Athens he reported the calamity which had happened; and the wives of the men who had gone on the expedition to Egina  hearing it and being very indignant that he alone of all had survived  came round this man and proceeded to stab him with the brooches of their mantles  each one of them asking of him where her husband was. Thus he was slain; and to the Athenians it seemed that the deed of the women was a much more terrible thing even than the calamity which had happened; and not knowing  it is said  how they should punish the women in any other way  they changed their fashion of dress to that of Ionia — for before this the women of the Athenians wore Dorian dress  very like that of Corinth — they changed it therefore to the linen tunic  in order that they might not have use for brooches.,mashup

In truth however this fashion of dress is not Ionian originally but Carian  for the old Hellenic fashion of dress for women was universally the same as that which we now call Dorian. Moreover it is said that with reference to these events the Argives and Eginetans made it a custom among themselves in both countries to have the brooches made half as large again as the size which was then established in use  and that their women should offer brooches especially in the temple of these goddesses  and also that they should carry neither pottery of Athens nor anything else of Athenian make to the temple  but that it should be the custom for the future to drink there from pitchers made in the lands themselves.,mashup

The women of the Argives and Eginetans from this time onwards because of the quarrel with the Athenians continued to wear brooches larger than before  and still do so even to my time; and the origin of the enmity of the Athenians towards the Eginetans came in the manner which has been said. So at this time  when the Thebans invaded them  the Eginetans readily came to the assistance of the Boeotians  calling to mind what occurred about the images. The Eginetans then were laying waste  as I have said  the coast regions of Attica; and when the Athenians were resolved to make an expedition against the Eginetans  an oracle came to them from Delphi bidding them stay for thirty years reckoned from the time of the wrong done by the Eginetans  and in the one-and-thirtieth year to appoint a sacred enclosure for Aiacos and then to begin the war against the Eginetans  and they would succeed as they desired; but if they should make an expedition against them at once  they would suffer in the meantime very much evil and also inflict very much  but at last they would subdue them. When the Athenians heard the report of this  they appointed a sacred enclosure for Aiacos  namely that which is now established close to the market- place  but they could not endure to hear that they must stay for thirty years  when they had suffered injuries from the Eginetans.,mashup

While however they were preparing to take vengeance  a matter arose from the Lacedemonians which provided a hindrance to them: for the Lacedemonians  having learnt that which had been contrived by the Alcmaionidai with respect to the Pythian prophetess  and that which had been contrived by the Pythian prophetess against themselves and the sons of Peisistratos  were doubly grieved  not only because they had driven out into exile men who were their guest-friends  but also because after they had done this no gratitude was shown to them by the Athenians. Moreover in addition to this  they were urged on by the oracles which said that many injuries would be suffered by them from the Athenians; of which oracles they had not been aware of before  but they had come to know them  since Cleomenes had brought them to Sparta. In fact Cleomenes had obtained from the Acropolis of the Athenians those oracles which the sons of Peisistratos possessed before and had left in the temple when they were driven out; and Cleomenes recovered them after they had been left behind.,mashup

For the established order of the Corinthian State was this:— the government was an oligarchy  and the oligarchs  who were called Bacchiadai  had control over the State and made marriages among themselves. Now one of these men  named Amphion  had a daughter born to him who was lame  and her name was Labda. This daughter  since none of the Bacchiadai wished to marry her  was taken to wife by Aëtion the son of Echecrates  who was of the deme of Petra  but by original descent a Lapith and of the race of Caineus. Neither from this wife nor from another were children born to him  therefore he set out to Delphi to inquire about offspring; and as he entered  forthwith the prophetess addressed him in these lines:'Much to be honoured art thou  yet none doth render thee honour. Labda conceives  and a rolling rock will she bear  which shall ruin Down on the heads of the kings  and with chastisement visit Corinthos.' This answer given to Aëtion was by some means reported to the Bacchiadai  to whom the oracle which had come to Corinth before this was not intelligible  an oracle which had reference to the same thing as that of Aëtion and said thus:'An eagle conceives in the rocks and shall bear a ravening lion  Strong and fierce to devour  who the knees of many shall loosen. Ponder this well in your minds  I bid you  Corinthians  whose dwelling Lies about fair Peirene's spring and in craggy Corinthos.',mashup

This oracle  I say  having come before to the Bacchiadai was obscure; but afterwards when they heard that which had come to Aëtion  forthwith they understood the former also  that it was in accord with that of Aëtion; and understanding this one also they kept quiet  desiring to destroy the offspring which should be born to Aëtion. Then  so soon as his wife bore a child  they sent ten of their own number to the deme in which Aëtion had his dwelling  to slay the child; and when these had come to Petra and had passed into the court of Aëtion's house  they asked for the child; and Labda  not knowing anything of the purpose for which they had come  and supposing them to be asking for the child on account of friendly feeling towards its father  brought it and placed it in the hands of one of them. Now they  it seems  had resolved by the way that the first of them who received the child should dash it upon the ground. However  when Labda brought and gave it  it happened by divine providence that the child smiled at the man who had received it; and when he perceived this  a feeling of compassion prevented him from killing it  and having this compassion he delivered it to the next man  and he to the third. Thus it passed through the hands of all the ten  delivered from one to another  since none of them could bring himself to destroy its life. So they gave the child back to its mother and went out; and then standing by the doors they abused and found fault with one another  laying blame especially on the one who had first received the child  because he had not done according to that which had been resolved; until at last after some time they determined again to enter and all to take a share in the murder.,mashup

From the offspring of Aëtion however it was destined that evils should spring up for Corinth: for Labda was listening to all this as she stood close by the door  and fearing lest they should change their mind and take the child a second time and kill it  she carried it and concealed it in the place which seemed to her the least likely to be discovered  that is to say a corn-chest  feeling sure that if they should return and come to a search  they were likely to examine everything: and this in fact happened. So when they had come  and searching had failed to find it  they thought it best to return and say to those who had sent them that they had done all that which they had been charged by them to do.,mashup

They then having departed said this; and after this the son of Aëtion grew  and because he had escaped this danger  the name of Kypselos was given him as a surname derived from the corn-chest. Then when Kypselos had grown to manhood and was seeking divination  a two-edged answer was given him at Delphi  placing trust in which he made an attempt upon Corinth and obtained possession of it. Now the answer was as follows:'Happy is this man's lot of a truth  who enters my dwelling  Offspring of Aëtion  he shall rule in famous Corinthos  Kypselos  he and his sons  but his children's children no longer.' Such was the oracle: and Kypselos when he became despot was a man of this character — many of the Corinthians he drove into exile  many he deprived of their wealth  and very many more of their lives.,mashup

Now Periander at first was milder than his father; but after he had had dealings through messengers with Thrasybulos the despot of Miletos  he became far more murderous even than Kypselos. For he sent a messenger to Thrasybulos and asked what settlement of affairs was the safest for him to make  in order that he might best govern his State: and Thrasybulos led forth the messenger who had come from Periander out of the city  and entered into a field of growing corn; and as he passed through the crop of corn  while inquiring and asking questions repeatedly of the messenger about the occasion of his coming from Corinth  he kept cutting off the heads of those ears of corn which he saw higher than the rest; and as he cut off their heads he cast them away  until he had destroyed in this manner the finest and richest part of the crop. So having passed through the place and having suggested no word of counsel  he dismissed the messenger. When the messenger returned to Corinth  Periander was anxious to hear the counsel which had been given; but he said that Thrasybulos had given him no counsel  and added that he wondered at the deed of Periander in sending him to such a man  for the man was out of his senses and a waster of his own goods — relating at the same time that which he had seen Thrasybulos do.,mashup

So Periander  understanding that which had been done and perceiving that Thrasybulos counselled him to put to death those who were eminent among his subjects  began then to display all manner of evil treatment to the citizens of the State; for whatsoever Kypselos had left undone in killing and driving into exile  this Periander completed. And in one day he stripped all the wives of the Corinthians of their clothing on account of his own wife Melissa. For when he had sent messengers to the Thesprotians on the river Acheron to ask the Oracle of the dead about a deposit made with him by a guest-friend  Melissa appeared and said she would not tell in what place the deposit was laid  for she was cold and had no clothes  since those which he had buried with her were of no use to her  not having been burnt; and this  she said  would be an evidence to him that she was speaking the truth  namely that when the oven was cold  Periander had put his loaves into it. When the report of this was brought back to Periander  the token made him believe  because he had had commerce with Melissa after she was dead; and straightway after receiving the message he caused proclamation to be made that all the wives of the Corinthians should come out to the temple of Hera. They accordingly went as to a festival in their fairest adornment; and he having set the spearmen of his guard in ambush  stripped them all alike  both the free women and their attendant; and having gathered together all their clothes in a place dug out  he set fire to them  praying at the same time to Melissa. Then after he had done this and had sent a second time  the apparition of Melissa told him in what spot he had laid the deposit entrusted to him by his guest-friend.Such a thing  ye must know  Lacedemonians  is despotism  and such are its deeds: and we Corinthians marvelled much at first when we saw that ye were sending for Hippias  and now we marvel even more because ye say these things; and we adjure you  calling upon the gods of Hellas  not to establish despotisms in the cities. If however ye will not cease from your design  but endeavour to restore Hippias contrary to that which is just  know that the Corinthians at least do not give their consent to that which ye do.,mashup

Socles being the envoy of Corinth thus spoke  and Hippias made answer to him  calling to witness the same gods as he  that assuredly the Corinthians would more than all others regret the loss of the sons of Peisistratos  when the appointed days should have come for them to be troubled by the Athenians. Thus Hippias made answer  being acquainted with the oracles more exactly than any other man: but the rest of the allies  who for a time had restrained themselves and kept silence  when they heard Socles speak freely  gave utterance every one of them to that which they felt  and adopted the opinion of the Corinthian envoy  adjuring the Lacedemonians not to do any violence to a city of Hellas.,mashup

Thus was this brought to an end: and Hippias being dismissed from thence had Anthemus offered to him by Amyntas king of the Macedonians and Iolcos by the Thessalians. He however accepted neither of these  but retired again to Sigeion; which city Peisistratos had taken by force of arms from the Mytilenians  and having got possession of it  had appointed his own natural son Hegesistratos  born of an Argive woman  to be despot of it: he however did not without a struggle keep possession of that which he received from Peisistratos; for the Mytilenians and Athenians carried on war for a long time  having their strongholds respectively at Achilleion and at Sigeion  the one side demanding that the place be restored to them  and the Athenians on the other hand not admitting this demand  but proving by argument that the Aiolians had no better claim to the territory of Ilion than they and the rest of the Hellenes  as many as joined with Menelaos in exacting vengeance for the rape of Helen.,mashup

Now while these carried on the war  besides many other things of various kinds which occurred in the battles  once when a fight took place and the Athenians were conquering  Alcaios the poet  taking to flight  escaped indeed himself  but the Athenians retained possession of his arms and hung them up on the walls of the temple of Athene which is at Sigeion. About this matter Alcaios composed a song and sent it to Mytilene  reporting therein his misadventure to one Melanippos  who was his friend. Finally Periander the son of Kypselos made peace between the Athenians and the Mytilenians  for to him they referred the matter as arbitrator; and he made peace between them on the condition that each should continue to occupy that territory which they then possessed.,mashup

Sigeion then in this matter had come under the rule of the Athenians. And when Hippias had returned to Asia from Lacedemon  he set everything in motion  stirring up enmity between the Athenians and Artaphrenes  and using every means to secure that Athens should come under the rule of himself and of Dareios. Hippias  I say  was thus engaged; and the Athenians meanwhile hearing of these things sent envoys to Sardis  and endeavoured to prevent the Persians from following the suggestions of the exiled Athenians. Artaphrenes however commanded them  if they desired to be preserved from ruin  to receive Hippias back again. This proposal the Athenians were not by any means disposed to accept when it was reported; and as they did not accept this  it became at once a commonly received opinion among them that they were enemies of the Persians.,mashup

While they had these thoughts and had been set at enmity with the Persians  at this very time Aristagoras the Milesian  ordered away from Sparta by Cleomenes the Lacedemonian  arrived at Athens; for this was the city which had most power of all the rest besides Sparta. And Aristagoras came forward before the assembly of the people and said the same things as he had said at Sparta about the wealth which there was in Asia  and about the Persian manner of making war  how they used neither shield nor spear and were easy to overcome. Thus I say he said  and also he added this  namely that the Milesians were colonists from the Athenians  and that it was reasonable that the Athenians should rescue them  since they had such great power; and there was nothing which he did not promise  being very urgent in his request  until at last he persuaded them: for it would seem that it is easier to deceive many than one  seeing that  though he did not prove able to deceive Cleomenes the Lacedemonian by himself  yet he did this to thirty thousand Athenians. The Athenians then  I say  being persuaded  voted a resolution to despatch twenty ships to help the Ionians  and appointed to command them Melanthios one of their citizens  who was in all things highly reputed. These ships proved to be the beginning of evils for the Hellenes and the Barbarians.,mashup

Aristagoras however sailed on before and came to Miletos; and then having devised a plan from which no advantage was likely to come for the Ionians (nor indeed was he doing what he did with a view to that  but in order to vex king Dareios )  he sent a man to Phrygia to the Piaonians who had been taken captive by Megabazos from the river Strymon  and who were dwelling in a district and village of Phrygia apart by themselves; and when the messenger came to the Paionians he spoke these words:Paionians  Aristagoras the despot of Miletos sent me to offer to you salvation  if ye shall be willing to do as he says; for now all Ionia has revolted from the king and ye have an opportunity of coming safe to your own land: to reach the sea shall be your concern  and after this it shall be thenceforth ours. The Paionians hearing this received it as a most welcome proposal  and taking with them their children and their women they began a flight to the sea; some of them however were struck with fear and remained in the place where they were. Having come to the coast the Paionians crossed over thence to Chios  and when they were already in Chios there arrived in their track a large body of Persian horsemen pursuing the Paionians. These  as they did not overtake them  sent over to Chios to bid the Paionians return back: the Paionians however did not accept their proposal  but the men of Chios conveyed them from Chios to Lesbos  and the Lesbians brought them to Doriscos  and thence they proceeded by land and came to Paionia.,mashup

From plundering this city after they had taken it they were prevented by this:— the houses in Sardis were mostly built of reeds  and even those of them which were of brick had their roofs thatched with reeds: of these houses one was set on fire by a soldier  and forthwith the fire going on from house to house began to spread over the whole town. So then as the town was on fire  the Lydians and all the Persians who were in the city being cut off from escape  since the fire was prevailing in the extremities round about them  and not having any way out of the town  flowed together to the market-place and to the river Pactolos  which brings down gold-dust for them from Tmolos  flowing through the middle of their market-place  and then runs out into the river Hermos  and this into the sea;— to this Pactolos  I say  and to the market-place the Lydians and Persians gathered themselves together  and were compelled to defend themselves.

They sailed moreover to the Hellespont and brought under their power Byzantion and all the other cities which are in those parts; and then having sailed forth out of the Hellespont  they gained in addition the most part of Caria to be in alliance with them: for even Caunos  which before was not willing to be their ally  then  after they had burnt Sardis  was added to them also.,mashup

The Cyprians too  excepting those of Amathus  were added voluntarily to their alliance; for these also had revolted from the Medes in the following manner:— there was one Onesilos  younger brother of Gorgos king of Salamis  and son of Chersis  the son of Siromos  the son of Euelthon. This man in former times too had been wont often to advise Gorgos to make revolt from the king  and at this time  when he heard that the Ionians had revolted  he pressed him very hard and endeavoured to urge him to it. Since however he could not persuade Gorgos  Onesilos watched for a time when he had gone forth out of the city of Salamis  and then together with the men of his own faction he shut him out of the gates. Gorgos accordingly being robbed of the city went for refuge to the Medes  and Onesilos was ruler of Salamis and endeavoured to persuade all the men of Cyprus to join him in revolt. The others then he persuaded; but since those of Amathus were not willing to do as he desired  he sat down before their city and besieged it.,mashup

When he had given this charge  he called into his presence Histiaios the Milesian  whom Dareios had now been keeping with him for a long time  and said:I am informed  Histiaios  that thy deputy  to whom thou didst depute the government of Miletos  has made rebellion against me; for he brought in men against me from the other continent and persuaded the Ionians also — who shall pay the penalty to me for that which they did — these  I say  he persuaded to go together with them  and thus he robbed me of Sardis. Now therefore how thinkest thou that this is well? and how without thy counsels was anything of this kind done? Take heed lest thou afterwards find reason to blame thyself for this. Histiaios replied:O king  what manner of speech is this that thou hast uttered  saying that I counselled a matter from which it was likely that any vexation would grow for thee  either great or small? What have I to seek for in addition to that which I have  that I should do these things; and of what am I in want? for I have everything that thou hast  and I am thought worthy by thee to hear all thy counsels. Nay  but if my deputy is indeed acting in any such manner as thou hast said  be assured that he has done it merely on his own account. I however  for my part  do not even admit the report to be true  that the Milesians and my deputy are acting in any rebellious fashion against thy power: but if it prove that they are indeed doing anything of that kind  and if that which thou hast heard  O king  be the truth  learn then what a thing thou didst in removing me away from the sea-coast; for it seems that the Ionians  when I had gone out of the sight of their eyes  did that which they had long had a desire to do; whereas if I had been in Ionia  not a city would have made the least movement. Now therefore as quickly as possible let me set forth to go to Ionia  that I may order all these matters for thee as they were before  and deliver into thy hands this deputy of Miletos who contrived these things: and when I have done this after thy mind  I swear by the gods of the royal house that I will not put off from me the tunic which I wear when I go down to Ionia  until I have made Sardinia tributary to thee  which is the largest of all islands.,mashup

Being informed of this  Onesilos sent heralds to different places in Ionia to summon the Ionians to his assistance; and they took counsel together and came without delay with a large force. Now the Ionians arrived in Cyprus just at the time when the Persians having crossed over in ships from Kilikia were proceeding by land to attack Salamis  while the Phenicians with the ships were sailing round the headland which is called theKeys of Cyprus.,mashup

This being the case  the despots of Cyprus called together the commanders of the Ionians and said:Ionians  we of Cyprus give you a choice which enemy ye will rather fight with  the Persians or the Phenicians: for if ye will rather array yourselves on land and make trial of the Persians in fight  it is time now for you to disembark from your ships and array yourselves on the land  and for us to embark in your ships to contend against the Phenicians; but if on the other hand ye will rather make trial of the Phenicians — whichever of these two ye shall choose  ye must endeavour that  so far as it rests with you  both Ionia and Cyprus shall be free. To this the Ionians replied:We were sent out by the common authority of the Ionians to guard the sea  and not to deliver our ships to the Cyprians and ourselves fight with the Persians on land. We therefore will endeavour to do good service in that place to which we were appointed; and ye must call to mind all the evils which ye suffered from the Medes  when ye were in slavery to them  and prove yourselves good men.,mashup

Onesilos accordingly being informed of this  and having a shield-bearer  by race of Caria  who was of very good repute as a soldier and full of courage besides  said to this man:I am informed that the horse of Artybios rears upright and works both with his feet and his mouth against any whom he is brought to attack. Do thou therefore consider the matter  and tell me forthwith which of the two thou wilt rather watch for and strike  the horse or Artybios himself. To this his attendant replied:O king  I am ready to do both or either of these two things  and in every case to do that which thou shalt appoint for me; but I will declare to thee the way in which I think it will be most suitable for thy condition. I say that it is right for one who is king and commander to fight with a king and commander; for if thou shalt slay the commander of the enemy  it turns to great glory for thee; and again  if he shall slay thee  which heaven forbid  even death when it is at the hands of a worthy foe is but half to be lamented: but for us who are under thy command it is suitable to fight with the others who are under his command and with his horse: and of the tricks of the horse have thou no fear at all  for I engage to thee that after this at least he shall never stand against any man more.

This having so come to pass  the Amathusians consulted an Oracle about the head  and they received an answer bidding them take it down and bury it and sacrifice to Onesilos every year as a hero; and if they did this  it would go better with them.,mashup

The Cyprians then  after they had made themselves free for one year  had again been reduced to slavery afresh: and meanwhile Daurises  who was married to a daughter of Dareios  and Hymaies and Otanes  who were also Persian commanders and were married also to daughters of Dareios  after they had pursued those Ionians who had made the expedition to Sardis and defeating them in battle had driven them by force to their ships — after this distributed the cities amongst themselves and proceeded to sack them.,mashup

And  as it chanced  a report of this was brought to the Carians before Daurises arrived; and the Carians being informed of it gathered together at the place which is called theWhite Pillars and at the river Marsyas  which flows from the region of Idrias and runs out into the Maiander. When the Carians had been gathered together there  among many other counsels which were given  the best  as it seems to me  was that of Pixodaros the son of Mausolos  a man of Kindye  who was married to the daughter of the king of the Kilikians  Syennesis. The opinion of this man was to the effect that the Carians should cross over the Maiander and engage battle with the Persians having the river at their backs  in order that the Carians  not being able to fly backwards and being compelled to remain where they were  might prove themselves even better men in fight than they naturally would. This opinion did not prevail; but they resolved that the Persians rather than themselves should have the Maiander at their backs  evidently in order that if there should be a flight of the Persians and they should be worsted in the battle  they might never return home  but might fall into the river.,mashup

After this  when the Persians had come and had crossed the Maiander  the Carians engaged with the Persians on the river Marsyas and fought a battle which was obstinately contested and lasted long; but at length they were worsted by superior numbers: and of the Persians there fell as many as two thousand  but of the Carians ten thousand. Then those of them who escaped were shut up in Labraunda within the sanctuary of Zeus Stratios  which is a large sacred grove of plane-trees; now the Carians are the only men we know who offer sacrifices to Zeus Stratios. These men then  being shut up there  were taking counsel together about their safety  whether they would fare better if they delivered themselves over to the Persians or if they left Asia altogether.,mashup

And while they were thus taking counsel  there came to their aid the Milesians and their allies. Then the Carians dismissed the plans which they were before considering and prepared to renew the war again from the beginning: and when the Persians came to attack them  they engaged with them and fought a battle  and they were worsted yet more completely than before; and while many were slain of all parties  the Milesians suffered most.,mashup

While the cities were thus being taken  Aristagoras the Milesian  being  as he proved in this instance  not of very distinguished courage  since after having disturbed Ionia and made preparation of great matters he counselled running away when he saw these things  (moreover it had become clear to him that it was impossible to overcome king Dareios ) — he  I say  having regard to these things  called together those of his own party and took counsel with them  saying that it was better that there should be a refuge prepared for them  in case that they should after all be driven out from Miletos  and proposing the question whether he should lead them from thence to Sardinia  to form a colony there  or to Myrkinos in the land of the Edonians  which Histiaios had been fortifying  having received it as a gift from Dareios. This was the question proposed by Aristagoras.,mashup

Now the opinion of Hecataios the son of Hegesander the historian was that he should not take a colony to either of these places  but build a wall of defence for himself in the island of Leros and keep still  if he should be forced to leave Miletos; and afterwards with this for his starting point he would be able to return to Miletos.,mashup

This was the counsel of Hecataios; but Aristagoras was most inclined to go forth to Myrkinos. He therefore entrusted the government of Miletos to Pythagoras  a man of repute among the citizens  and he himself sailed away to Thrace  taking with him every one who desired to go; and he took possession of the region for which he had set out. But starting from this to make war  he perished by the hands of the Thracians  that is both Aristagoras himself and his army  when he was encamped about a certain city and the Thracians desired to go out from it under a truce.,mashup

Then Artaphrenes seeing that he was using dissimulation said  having knowledge of the truth about the revolt:Thus it is with thee  Histiaios  about these matters — this shoe was stitched by thee  and put on by Aristagoras.,mashup

Thus said Artaphrenes with reference to the revolt; and Histiaios fearing Artaphrenes because he understood the matter  ran away the next night at nightfall and went to the sea- coast  having deceived king Dareios  seeing that he had engaged to subdue Sardinia the largest of islands  and instead of that he was endeavouring to take upon himself leadership of the Ionians in the war against Dareios. Then having crossed over to Chios he was put in bonds by the Chians  being accused by them of working for a change of their State by suggestion of Dareios. When however the Chians learnt the whole story and heard that he was an enemy to the king  they released him.,mashup

Then Histiaios  being asked by the Ionians for what reason he had so urgently charged Aristagoras to revolt from the king and had wrought so great an evil for the Ionians  did not by any means declare to them that which had been in truth the cause  but reported to them that king Dareios had resolved to remove the Phenicians from their land and to settle them in Ionia  and the Ionians in Phenicia; and for this reason  he said  he had given the charge.

As regards Sardis therefore there was confusion of the design; and when Histiaios had been disappointed of this hope  the Chians attempted to restore him to Miletos at the request of Histiaios himself. The Milesians  however  who had been rejoiced before to be rid of Aristagoras  were by no means eager to receive another despot into their land  seeing that they had tasted of liberty: and in fact Histiaios  attempting to return to Miletos by force and under cover of night  was wounded in the thigh by one of the Milesians. He then  being repulsed from his own city  returned to Chios; and thence  as he could not persuade the Chians to give him ships  he crossed over to Mytilene and endeavoured to persuade the Lesbians to give him ships. So they manned eight triremes and sailed with Histiaios to Byzantion  and stationing themselves there they captured the ships which sailed out of the Pontus  excepting where the crews of them said that they were ready to do the bidding of Histiaios.,mashup

These were the ships of the Ionians; and of the Barbarians the number of ships was six hundred. When these too were come to the Milesian coast and their whole land-army was also there  then the commanders of the Persians  being informed of the number of the Ionian ships  were struck with fear lest they should be unable to overcome them  and thus on the one hand should not be able to conquer Miletos from not having command of the sea  and at the same time should run a risk of being punished by Dareios. Reflecting upon these things they gathered together the despots of the Ionians who were exiles with the Medes  having been deposed from their governments by Aristagoras the Milesian  and who chanced to be then joining in the expedition against Miletos — of these men they called together those who were present and spoke to them as follows:Ionians  now let each one of you show himself a benefactor of the king's house  that is to say  let each one of you endeavour to detach his own countrymen from the body of the alliance: and make your proposals promising at the same time that they shall suffer nothing unpleasant on account of the revolt  and neither their temples nor their private houses shall be burnt  nor shall they have any worse treatment than they had before this; but if they will not do so  but will by all means enter into a contest with us  threaten them and tell them this  which in truth shall happen to them  namely that if they are worsted in the fight they shall be reduced to slavery  and we shall make their sons eunuchs  and their maidens we shall remove to Bactria  and deliver their land to others.,mashup

This happened as soon as the Persians came to Miletos; and after this the Ionians being gathered together at Lade held meetings; and others no doubt also made speeches to them  but especially the Phocaian commander Dionysios  who said as follows:Seeing that our affairs are set upon the razor's edge  Ionians  whether we shall be free or slaves  and slaves too to be dealt with as runaways  now therefore if ye shall be willing to take upon yourselves hardships  ye will have labour for the time being  but ye will be able to overcome the enemy and be free; whereas if ye continue to be self-indulgent and without discipline  I have no hope for you that ye will not pay the penalty to the king for your revolt.

Hearing this the Ionians delivered themselves to Dionysios; and he used to bring the ships out every day in single file  that he might practise the rowers by making the ships break through one another's line  and that he might get the fighting-men in the ships under arms; an then for the rest of the day he would keep the ships at anchor; and thus he gave the Ionians work to do during the whole day. For seven days then they submitted and did that which he commanded; but on the day after these the Ionians  being unaccustomed to such toils and being exhausted with hard work and hot sun  spoke to one another thus:Against which of the deities have we offended  that we thus fill up the measure of evil? for surely we have delivered ourselves to a Phocaian  an impostor  who furnishes but three ships: and he has taken us into his hands and maltreats us with evil dealing from which we can never recover; and many of us in fact have fallen into sicknesses  and many others  it may be expected  will suffer the same thing shortly; and for us it is better to endure anything else in the world rather than these ills  and to undergo the slavery which will come upon us  whatever that shall be  rather than to be oppressed by that which we have now. Come  let us not obey him after this any more. So they said  and forthwith after this every one refused to obey him  and they pitched their tents in the island like an army  and kept in the shade  and would not go on board their ships or practise any exercises.,mashup

Perceiving this which was being done by the Ionians  the commanders of the Samians then at length accepted from Aiakes the son of Syloson those proposals which Aiakes sent before at the bidding of the Persians  asking them to leave the alliance of the Ionians; the Samians  I say  accepted these proposals  perceiving that there was great want of discipline on the part of the Ionians  while at the same time it was clear to them that it was impossible to overcome the power of the king; and they well knew also that even if they should overcome the present naval force of Dareios  another would be upon them five times as large. Having found an occasion then  so soon as they saw that the Ionians refused to be serviceable  they counted it gain for themselves to save their temples and their private property. Now Aiakes  from whom the Samians accepted the proposals  was the son of Syloson  the son of Aiakes  and being despot of Samos he had been deprived of his rule by Aristagoras the Milesian  like the other despots of Ionia.,mashup

So when the Phenicians sailed to the attack  the Ionians also put out their ships from shore against them  sailing in single file: and when they came near and engaged battle with one another  as regards what followed I am not able exactly to record which of the Ionians showed themselves cowards or good men in this sea-fight  for they throw blame upon one another. The Samians however  it is said  according to their agreement with Aiakes put up their sails then and set forth from their place in the line to sail back to Samos  excepting only eleven ships: of these the captains stayed in their places and took part in the sea-fight  refusing to obey the commanders of their division; and the public authority of the Samians granted them on account of this to have their names written up on a pillar with their fathers' names also  as having proved themselves good men; and this pillar exists still in the market-place. Then the Lesbians also  when they saw that those next them in order were taking to flight  did the same things as the Samians had done  and so also most of the Ionians did the very same thing.,mashup

The part of it which had reference to the Argives I will record when I reach that place in the history  but that which the Oracle uttered with reference to the Milesians  who were not there present  is as follows:And at that time  O Miletos  of evil deeds the contriver  Thou shalt be made for many a glorious gift and a banquet: Then shall thy wives be compelled to wash the feet of the long-haired  And in Didyma then my shrine shall be tended by others. At the time of which I speak these things came upon the Milesians  since most of the men were killed by the Persians  who are long- haired  and the women and children were dealt with as slaves; and the temple at Didyma  with the sacred building and the sanctuary of the Oracle  was first plundered and then burnt.

When the Milesians suffered this treatment from the Persians  the men of Sybaris  who were dwelling in Laos and Skidros  being deprived of their own city  did not repay like with like: for when Sybaris was taken by the men of Croton  the Milesians all from youth upwards shaved their heads and put on great mourning: for these cities were more than all others of which we know bound together by ties of friendship. Not like the Sybarites were the Athenians; for these made it clear that they were grieved at the capture of Miletos  both in many other ways and also by this  that when Phrynichos had composed a drama called theCapture of Miletos and had put it on the stage  the body of spectators fell to weeping  and the Athenians moreover fined the poet a thousand drachmas on the ground that he had reminded them of their own calamities; and they ordered also that no one in future should represent this drama.,mashup

Miletos then had been stripped bare of its former inhabitants: but of the Samians they who had substance were by no means satisfied with that which had been concerted by the commanders of their fleet with the Medes; and taking counsel forthwith after the sea-fight it seemed good to them  before their despot Aiakes arrived in the country  to sail away and make a colony  and not to stay behind and be slaves of the Medes and of Aiakes: for just at this time the people of Zancle in Sicily were sending messengers to Ionia and inviting the Ionians to come to theFair Strand  desiring there to found a city of Ionians. Now this which is called the Fair Strand is in the land of the Sikelians and on that side of Sicily which lies towards Tyrsenia. So when these gave the invitation  the Samians alone of all the Ionians set forth  having with them those of the Milesians who had escaped: and in the course of this matter it happened as follows:—,mashup

The Samians as they made their way towards Sicily reached Locroi Epizephyroi  and at the same time the people of Zancle  both themselves and their king  whose name was Skythes  were encamped about a city of the Sikelians  desiring to conquer it. Perceiving these things  Anaxilaos the despot of Rhegion  being then at variance with those of Zancle  communicated with the Samians and persuaded them that they ought to leave the Fair Strand alone  to which they were sailing  and take possession of Zancle instead  since it was left now without men to defend it. The Samians accordingly did as he said and took possession of Zancle; and upon this the men of Zancle  being informed that their city was possessed by an enemy  set out to rescue it  and invited Hippocrates the despot of Gela to help them  for he was their ally. When however Hippocrates also with his army had come up to their rescue  first he put Skythes the ruler of the Zanclaians in fetters  on the ground that he had been the cause of the city being lost  and together with him his brother Pythogenes  and sent them away to the town of Incyos; then he betrayed the cause of the remaining Zanclaians by coming to terms with the Samians and exchanging oaths with them; and in return for this it had been promised by the Samians that Hippocrates should receive as his share the half of all the movable goods in the city and of the slaves  and the whole of the property in the fields round. So the greater number of the Zanclaians he put in bonds and kept himself as slaves  but the chief men of them  three hundred in number  he gave to the Samians to put to death; which however the Samians did not do.,mashup

Now Skythes the ruler of the Zanclaians escaped from Incyos to Himera  and thence he came to Asia and went up to the court of Dareios: and Dareios accounted him the most righteous of all the men who had come up to him from Hellas; for he obtained leave of the king and went away to Sicily  and again came back from Sicily to the king; and at last he brought his life to an end among the Persians in old age and possessing great wealth. The Samians then  having got rid of the rule of the Medes  had gained for themselves without labour the fair city of Zancle.,mashup

Upon that he entrusted the matters which had to do with the Hellespont to Bisaltes the son of Apollophanes  a man of Abydos  while he himself with the Lesbians sailed to Chios; and when a body of the Chians who were on guard did not allow him to approach  he fought with them at that spot in the Chian land which is called theHollows. Histiaios then not only slew many of these  but also  taking Polichne of the Chians as his base  he conquered with the help of the Lesbians the remainder of the Chians as well  since they had suffered great loss by the sea-fight.,mashup

And heaven is wont perhaps to give signs beforehand whenever great evils are about to happen to a city or a race of men; for to the Chians also before these events remarkable signs had come. In the first place when they had sent to Delphi a chorus of a hundred youths  two only returned home  the remaining ninety-eight of them having been seized by a plague and carried off; and then secondly in their city about the same time  that is shortly before the sea-fight  as some children were being taught in school the roof fell in upon them  so that of a hundred and twenty children only one escaped. These signs God showed to them beforehand; and after this the sea-fight came upon them and brought their State down upon its knees; and as the Chians had suffered great loss  he without difficulty effected the conquest of them.,mashup

Thence Histiaios made an expedition against Thasos  taking with him a large force of Ionians and Aiolians; and while he was encamped about the town of Thasos  a report came to him that the Phenicians were sailing up from Miletos to conquer the rest of Ionia. Being informed of this he left Thasos unconquered and himself hastened to Lesbos  taking with him his whole army. Then  as his army was in want of food  he crossed over from Lesbos to reap the corn in Atarneus and also that in the plain of the Caicos  which belonged to the Mysians. In these parts there chanced to be a Persian named Harpagos commanding a considerable force; and this man fought a battle with him after he had landed  and he took Histiaios himself prisoner and destroyed the greater part of his army.,mashup

And Histiaios was taken prisoner in the following manner:— As the Hellenes were fighting with the Persians at Malene in the district of Atarneus  after they had been engaged in close combat for a long time  the cavalry at length charged and fell upon the Hellenes; and the cavalry in fact decided the battle. So when the Hellenes had been turned to flight  Histiaios trusting that he would not be put to death by the king on account of his present fault  conceived a love of life  so that when he was being caught in his flight by a Persian and was about to be run through by him in the moment of his capture  he spoke in Persian and made himself known  saying that he was Histiaios the Milesian.,mashup

Dareios having been informed of this  found fault with those who had done so  because they had not brought him up to his presence alive; and he bade wash the head of Histiaios and bestow upon it proper care  and then bury it  as that of one who had been greatly a benefactor both of the king himself and of the Persians.,mashup

They took also the Ionian cities on the mainland in the same manner  except that they did not sweep off the inhabitants thus  for it was not possible.,mashup

Departing from Ionia the fleet proceeded to conquer all the places of the Hellespont on the left as one sails in  for those on the right had been subdued already by the Persians themselves  approaching them by land. Now the cities of the Hellespont in Europe are these:— first comes the Chersonese  in which there are many cities  then Perinthos  the strongholds of the Thracian border  Selymbria  and Byzantion. The people of Byzantion and those of Calchedon opposite did not even wait for the coming of the Persian ships  but had left their own land first and departed  going within the Euxine; and there they settled in the city of Mesambria. So the Phenicians  having burnt these places which have been mentioned  directed their course next to Proconnesos and Artake; and when they had delivered these also to the flames  they sailed back to the Chersonese to destroy the remaining cities which they had not sacked when they touched there before: but against Kyzicos they did not sail at all; for the men of Kyzicos even before the time when the Phenicians sailed in had submitted to the king of their own accord  and had made terms with Oibares the son of Megabazos  the Persian governor at Daskyleion.,mashup

In the Chersonese then the Phenicians made themselves masters of all the other cities except the city of Cardia. Of these cities up to that time Miltiades the son of Kimon  the son of Stesagoras  had been despot  Miltiades the son of Kypselos having obtained this government in the manner which here follows:— The inhabitants of this Chersonese were Dolonkian Thracians; and these Dolonkians  being hard pressed in war by the Apsinthians  sent their kings to Delphi to consult the Oracle about the war. And the Pythian prophetess answered them that they must bring into their land as founder of a settlement the man who should first offer them hospitality as they returned from the temple. The Dolonkians then passed along the Sacred Road through the land of the Phokians and of the Boeotians  and as no man invited them  they turned aside and came to Athens.,mashup

This Miltiades was sitting in the entrance of his own dwelling  and seeing the Dolonkians going by with dress that was not of the native Athenian fashion and with spears  he shouted to them; and when they approached  he offered them lodging and hospitality. They then having accepted and having been entertained by him  proceeded to declare all the utterances of the Oracle; and having declared it they asked him to do as the god had said: and Miltiades when he heard it was at once disposed to agree  because he was vexed by the rule of Peisistratos and desired to be removed out of the way. He set out therefore forthwith to Delphi to inquire of the Oracle whether he should do that which the Dolonkians asked of him:,mashup

First then he made a wall across the isthmus of the Chersonese from the city of Cardia to Pactye  in order that the Apsinthians might not be able to invade the land and do them damage. Now the number of furlongs across the isthmus at this place is six-and-thirty  and from this isthmus the Chersonese within is altogether four hundred and twenty furlongs in length.,mashup

Having made a wall then across the neck of the Chersonese and having in this manner repelled the Apsinthians  Miltiades made war upon the people of Lampsacos first of all others; and the people of Lampsacos laid an ambush and took him prisoner. Now Miltiades had come to be a friend of Croesus the Lydian; and Croesus accordingly  being informed of this event  sent and commanded the people of Lampsacos to let Miltiades go; otherwise he threatened to destroy them utterly like a pine-tree. Then when the people of Lampsacos were perplexed in their counsels as to what that saying should mean with which Croesus had threatened them  namely that he would destroy them utterly like a pine-tree  at length one of the elder men with difficulty perceived the truth  and said that a pine alone of all trees when it has been cut down does not put forth any further growth but perishes  being utterly destroyed. The people of Lampsacos therefore fearing Croesus loosed Miltiades and let him go.,mashup

After this there was war with those of Lampsacos; and it happened to Stesagoras also that he died without leaving a son  having been struck on the head with an axe in the City Hall by a man who pretended to be a deserter  but who proved himself to be in fact an enemy and a rather hot one moreover.,mashup

Then after Stesagoras also had ended his life in this manner  Miltiades son of Kimon and brother of that Stesagoras who was dead  was sent in a trireme to the Chersonese to take possession of the government by the sons of Peisistratos  who had dealt well with him at Athens also  pretending that they had had no share in the death of his father Kimon  of which in another part of the history I will set forth how it came to pass. Now Miltiades  when he came to the Chersonese  kept himself within his house  paying honours in all appearance to the memory of his brother Stesagoras; and the chief men of the inhabitants of the Chersonese in every place  being informed of this  gathered themselves together from all the cities and came in a body to condole with him  and when they had come they were laid in bonds by him. Miltiades then was in possession of the Chersonese  supporting a body of five hundred mercenary troops; and he married the daughter of Oloros the king of the Thracians  who was named Hegesipyle.,mashup

And having set out from the city of Cardia he was sailing through the gulf of Melas; and as he passed along by the shore of the Chersonese  the Phenicians fell in with his ships  and while Miltiades himself with four of his ships escaped to Imbros  the fifth of his ships was captured in the pursuit by the Phenicians. Of this ship it chanced that Metiochos the eldest of the sons of Miltiades was in command  not born of the daughter of Oloros the Thracian  but of another woman. Him the Phenicians captured together with his ship; and being informed about him  that he was the son of Miltiades  they brought him up to the king  supposing that they would lay up for themselves a great obligation; because it was Miltiades who had declared as his opinion to the Ionians that they should do as the Scythians said  at that time when the Scythians requested them to break up the bridge of boats and sail away to their own land. Dareios however  when the Phenicians brought up to him Metiochos the son of Miltiades  did Metiochos no harm but on the contrary very much good; for he gave him a house and possessions and a Persian wife  by whom he had children born who have been ranked as Persians.

In the course of this year there was done by the Persians nothing more which tended to strife with the Ionians  but these things which follow were done in this year very much to their advantage.— Artaphrenes the governor of Sardis sent for envoys from all the cities and compelled the Ionians to make agreements among themselves  so that they might give satisfaction for wrongs and not plunder one another's land. This he compelled them to do  and also he measured their territories by parasangs — that is the name which the Persians give to the length of thirty furlongs — he measured  I say  by these  and appointed a certain amount of tribute for each people  which continues still unaltered from that time even to my own days  as it was appointed by Artaphrenes; and the tribute was appointed to be nearly of the same amount for each as it had been before.,mashup

These were things which tended to peace for the Ionians; but at the beginning of the spring  the other commanders having all been removed by the king  Mardonios the son of Gobryas came down to the sea  bringing with him a very large land-army and a very large naval force  being a young man and lately married to Artozostra daughter of king Dareios. When Mardonios leading this army came to Kilikia  he embarked on board a ship himself and proceeded together with the other ships  while other leaders led the land-army to the Hellespont. Mardonios however sailing along the coast of Asia came to Ionia: and here I shall relate a thing which will be a great marvel to those of the Hellenes who do not believe that to the seven men of the Persians Otanes declared as his opinion that the Persians ought to have popular rule; for Mardonios deposed all the despots of the Ionians and established popular governments in the cities. Having so done he hastened on to the Hellespont; and when there was collected a vast number of ships and a large land-army  they crossed over the Hellespont in the ships and began to make their way through Europe  and their way was directed against Eretria and Athens.,mashup

These  I say  furnished them the pretence for the expedition  but they had it in their minds to subdue as many as they could of the Hellenic cities; and in the first place they subdued with their ships the Thasians  who did not even raise a hand to defend themselves: then with the land-army they gained the Macedonians to be their servants in addition to those whom they had already; for all the nations on the East of the Macedonians had become subject to them already before this. Crossing over then from Thasos to the opposite coast  they proceeded on their way near the land as far as Acanthos  and then starting from Acanthos they attempted to get round Mount Athos; but as they sailed round  there fell upon them a violent North Wind  against which they could do nothing  and handled them very roughly  casting away very many of their ships on Mount Athos. It is said indeed that the number of the ships destroyed was three hundred   and more than twenty thousand men; for as this sea which is about Athos is very full of sea monsters  some were seized by these and so perished  while others were dashed against the rocks; and some of them did not know how to swim and perished for that cause  others again by reason of cold.,mashup

In the next year after this Dareios first sent a messenger to the men of Thasos  who had been accused by their neighbours of planning revolt  and bade them take away the wall around their town and bring their ships to Abdera. The Thasians in fact  as they had been besieged by Histiaios the Milesian and at the same time had large revenues coming in  were using their money in building ships of war and in surrounding their city with a stronger wall. Now the revenues came to them from the mainland and from the mines: from the gold-mines in Scapte Hyle there came in generally eighty talents a year  and from those in Thasos itself a smaller amount than this but so much that in general the Thasians  without taxes upon the produce of their soil  had a revenue from the mainland and from the mines amounting yearly to two hundred talents  and when the amount was highest  to three hundred.,mashup

I myself saw these mines  and by much the most marvellous of them were those which the Phenicians discovered  who made the first settlement in this island in company with Thasos; and the island had the name which it now has from this Thasos the Phenician. These Phenician mines are in that part of Thasos which is between the places called Ainyra and Koinyra and opposite Samothrake  where there is a great mountain which has been all turned up in the search for metal. Thus it is with this matter: and the Thasians on the command of the king both razed their walls and brought all their ships to Abdera.,mashup

After this Dareios began to make trial of the Hellenes  what they meant to do  whether to make war with him or to deliver themselves up. He sent abroad heralds therefore  and appointed them to go some to one place and others to another throughout Hellas  bidding them demand earth and water for the king. These  I say  he sent to Hellas; and meanwhile he was sending abroad other heralds to his own tributary cities which lay upon the sea-coast  and he bade them have ships of war built and also vessels to carry horses.,mashup

They then were engaged in preparing these things; and meanwhile when the heralds had come to Hellas  many of those who dwelt upon the mainland gave that for which the Persian made demand  and all those who dwelt in the islands did so  to whomsoever they came to make their demand. The islanders  I say  gave earth and water to Dareios  and among them also those of Egina  and when these had done so  the Athenians went forthwith urgent against them  supposing that the Eginetans had given with hostile purpose against themselves  in order to make an expedition against them in combination with the Persians; and also they were glad to get hold of an occasion against them. Accordingly they went backward and forwards to Sparta and accused the Eginetans of that which they had done  as having proved themselves traitors to Hellas.,mashup

In consequence of this accusation Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides  king of the Spartans  crossed over to Egina meaning to seize those of the Eginetans who were the most guilty; but as he was attempting to seize them  certain of the Eginetans opposed him  and among them especially Crios the son of Polycritos  who said that he should not with impunity carry off a single Eginetan  for he was doing this (said he ) without authority from the Spartan State  having been persuaded to it by the Athenians with money; otherwise he would have come and seized them in company with the other king: and this he said by reason of a message received from Demaratos. Cleomenes then as he departed from Egina  asked Crios what was his name  and he told him the truth; and Cleomenes said to him:Surely now  O Ram  thou must cover over thy horns with bronze for thou wilt shortly have a great trouble to contend with.,mashup

For the Lacedemonians  who herein agree with none of the poets  say that Aristodemos the son of Aristomachos  the son of Cleodaios  the son of Hyllos  being their king  led them himself (and not the sons of Aristodemos ) to this land which they now possess. Then after no long time the wife of Aristodemos  whose name was Argeia — she was the daughter  they say  of Autesion  the son of Tisamenes  the son of Thersander  the son of Polyneikes — she  it is said  brought forth twins; and Aristodemos lived but to see his children and then ended his life by sickness. So the Lacedemonians of that time resolved according to established custom to make the elder of the children their king; but they did not know which of them they should take  because they were like one another and of equal size; and when they were not able to make out  or even before this  they inquired of their mother; and she said that even she herself did not know one from the other. She said this  although she knew in truth very well  because she desired that by some means both might be made kings. The Lacedemonians then were in a strait; and being in a strait they sent to Delphi to inquire what they should do in the matter. And the Pythian prophetess bade them regard both children as their kings  but honour most the first in age. The prophetess  they say  thus gave answer to them; and when the Lacedemonians were at a loss none the less how to find out the elder of them  a Messenian whose name was Panites made a suggestion to them: this Panites  I say  suggested to the Lacedemonians that they should watch the mother and see which of the children she washed and fed before the other; and if she was seen to do this always in the same order  then they would have all that they were seeking and desiring to find out  but if she too was uncertain and did it in a different order at different times  it would be plain to them that even she had no more knowledge than any other  and they must turn to some other way. Then the Spartans following the suggestion of the Messenian watched the mother of the sons of Aristodemos and found that she gave honour thus to the first-born both in feeding and in washing; for she did not know with that design she was being watched. They took therefore the child which was honoured by its mother and brought it up as the first-born in the public hall  and to it was given the name of Eurysthenes  while the other was called Procles. These  when they had grown up  both themselves were at variance  they say  with one another  though they were brothers  throughout the whole time of their lives  and their descendants also continued after the same manner.,mashup

This is the report given by the Lacedemonians alone of all the Hellenes; but this which follows I write in accordance with that which is reported by the Hellenes generally — I mean that the names of these kings of the Dorians are rightly enumerated by the Hellenes up to Perseus the son of Danae (leaving the god out of account )  and proved to be of Hellenic race; for even from that time they were reckoned as Hellenes. I saidup to Perseus and did not take the descent from a yet higher point  because there is no name mentioned of a mortal father for Perseus  as Amphitryon is for Heracles. Therefore with reason  as is evident  I have saidrightly up to Perseus; but if one enumerates their ancestors in succession going back from Danae the daughter of Acrisios  the rulers of the Dorians will prove to be Egyptians by direct descent.,mashup

These are their privileges in war; and in peace moreover things have been assigned to them as follows:— if any sacrifice is performed at the public charge  it is the privilege of the kings to sit down at the feast before all others  and that the attendants shall begin with them first  and serve to each of them a portion of everything double of that which is given to the other guests  and that they shall have the first pouring of libations and the hides of the animals slain in sacrifice; that on every new moon and seventh day of the month there shall be delivered at the public charge to each one of these a full-grown victim in the temple of Apollo  and a measure of barley-groats and a Laconianquarter of wine; and that at all the games they shall have seats of honour specially set apart for them: moreover it is their privilege to appoint as protectors of strangers whomsoever they will of the citizens  and to choose each twoPythians: now the Pythians are men sent to consult the god at Delphi  and they eat with the kings at the public charge. And if the kings do not come to the dinner  it is the rule that there shall be sent out for them to their houses two quarts of barley-groats for each one and half a pint of wine; but if they are present  double shares of everything shall be given them  and moreover they shall be honoured in this same manner when they have been invited to dinner by private persons. The kings also  it is ordained  shall have charge of the oracles which are given  but the Pythians also shall have knowledge of them. It is the rule moreover that the kings alone give decision on the following cases only  that is to say  about the maiden who inherits her father's property  namely who ought to have her  if her father have not betrothed her to any one  and about public ways; also if any man desires to adopt a son  he must do it in presence of the kings: and it is ordained that they shall sit in council with the Senators  who are in number eight-and-twenty  and if they do not come  those of the Senators who are most closely related to them shall have the privileges of the kings and give two votes besides their own  making three in all.,mashup

These rights have been assigned to the kings for their lifetime by the Spartan State; and after they are dead these which follow:— horsemen go round and announce that which has happened throughout the whole of the Laconian land  and in the city women go about and strike upon a copper kettle. Whenever this happens so  two free persons of each household must go into mourning  a man and a woman  and for those who fail to do this great penalties are appointed. Now the custom of the Lacedemonians about the deaths of their kings is the same as that of the Barbarians who dwell in Asia  for most of the Barbarians practise the same customs as regards the death of their kings. Whensoever a king of the Lacedemonians is dead  then from the whole territory of Lacedemon  not reckoning the Spartans  a certain fixed number of thedwellers round are compelled to go to the funeral ceremony: and when there have been gathered together of these and of the Helots and of the Spartans themselves many thousands in the same place  with their women intermingled  they beat their foreheads with a good will and make lamentation without stint  saying that this one who has died last of their kings was the best of all: and whenever any of their kings has been killed in war  they prepare an image to represent him  laid upon a couch with fair coverings  and carry it out to be buried. Then after they have buried him  no assembly is held among them for ten days  nor is there any meeting for choice of magistrates  but they have mourning during these days.,mashup

In another respect too these resemble the Persians; that is to say  when the king is dead and another is appointed king  this king who is newly coming in sets free any man of the Spartans who was a debtor to the king or to the State; while among the Persians the king who comes to the throne remits to all the cities the arrears of tribute which are due.,mashup

In the following point also the Lacedemonians resemble the Egyptians; that is to say  their heralds and fluteplayers and cooks inherit the crafts of their fathers  and a fluteplayer is the son of a fluteplayer  a cook of a cook  and a herald of a herald; other men do not lay hands upon the office because they have loud and clear voices  and so shut them out of it  but they practise their craft by inheritance from their fathers.,mashup

Thus are these things done: and at this time of which we speak  while Cleomenes was in Egina doing deeds which were for the common service of Hellas  Demaratos brought charges against him  not so much because he cared for the Eginetans as because he felt envy and jealousy of him. Then Cleomenes  after he returned from Egina  planned to depose Demaratos from being king  making an attempt upon him on account of this matter which follows:— Ariston being king in Sparta and having married two wives  yet had no children born to him; and since he did not acknowledge that he himself was the cause of this  he married a third wife; and he married her thus:— he had a friend  a man of the Spartans  to whom of all the citizens Ariston was most inclined; and it chanced that this man had a wife who was of all the women in Sparta the fairest by far  and one too who had become the fairest from having been the foulest. For as she was mean in her aspect  her nurse  considering that she was the daughter of wealthy persons and was of uncomely aspect  and seeing moreover that her parents were troubled by it — perceiving I say these things  her nurse devised as follows:— every day she bore her to the temple of Helen  which is in the place called Therapne  lying above the temple of Phoebus; and whenever the nurse bore her thither  she placed her before the image and prayed the goddess to deliver the child from her unshapeliness. And once as the nurse was going away out of the temple  it is said that a woman appeared to her  and having appeared asked her what she was bearing in her arms; and she told her that she was bearing a child; upon which the other bade her show the child to her  but she refused  for it had been forbidden to her by the parents to show it to any one: but the woman continued to urge her by all means to show it to her. So then perceiving that the woman earnestly desired to see it  the nurse showed her the child. Then the woman stroking the head of the child said that she should be the fairest of all the women in Sparta; and from that day her aspect was changed. Afterwards when she came to the age for marriage  she was married to Agetos the son of Alkeides  this friend of Ariston of whom we spoke.,mashup

Now Ariston it seems was ever stung by the desire of this woman  and accordingly he contrived as follows:— he made an engagement himself with his comrade  whose wife this woman was  that he would give him as a gift one thing of his own possessions  whatsoever he should choose  and he bade his comrade make return to him in similar fashion. He therefore  fearing nothing for his wife  because he saw that Ariston also had a wife  agreed to this; and on these terms they imposed oaths on one another. After this Ariston on his part gave that which Agetos had chosen from the treasures of Ariston  whatever the thing was; and he himself  seeking to obtain from him the like return  endeavoured then to take away the wife of his comrade from him: and he said that he consented to give anything else except this one thing only  but at length being compelled by the oath and by the treacherous deception  he allowed her to be taken away from him.,mashup

He then  knowing the time when he took to him his wife  and reckoning the months upon his fingers  said  denying with an oath The child would not be mine. This the Ephors heard  but they thought it a matter of no importance at the moment; and the child grew up and Ariston repented of that which he had said  for he thought Demaratos was certainly his own son; and he gave him the nameDemaratos for this reason  namely because before these things took place the Spartan people all in a body had made a vow praying that a son might be born to Ariston  as one who was pre-eminent in renown over all the kings who had ever arisen in Sparta.,mashup

For this reason the name Demaratos was given to him. And as time went on Ariston died  and Demaratos obtained the kingdom: but it was fated apparently that these things should become known and should cause Demaratos to be deposed from the kingdom; and therefore Demaratos came to be at variance greatly with Cleomenes both at the former time when he withdrew his army from Eleusis  and also now especially  when Cleomenes had crossed over to take those of the Eginetans who had gone over to the Medes.,mashup

Cleomenes then  being anxious to take vengeance on him  concerted matters with Leotychides the son of Menares  the son of Agis  who was of the same house as Demaratos  under condition that if he should set him up as king instead of Demaratos  he would go with him against the Eginetans. Now Leotychides had become a bitter foe of Demaratos on account of this matter which follows:— Leotychides had betrothed himself to Percalos the daughter of Chilon son of Demarmenos; and Demaratos plotted against him and deprived Leotychides of his marriage  carrying off Percalos himself beforehand  and getting her for his wife. Thus had arisen the enmity of Leotychides against Demaratos; and now by the instigation of Cleomenes Leotychides deposed against Demaratos  saying that he was not rightfully reigning over the Spartans  not being a son of Ariston: and after this deposition he prosecuted a suit against him  recalling the old saying which Ariston uttered at the time when his servant reported to him that a son was born to him  and he reckoning up the months denied with an oath  saying that it was not his. Taking his stand upon this utterance  Leotychides proceeded to prove that Demaratos was not born of Ariston nor was rightfully reigning over Sparta; and he produced as witnesses those Ephors who chanced then to have been sitting with Ariston in council and to have heard him say this.,mashup

At last  as there was contention about those matters  the Spartans resolved to ask the Oracle at Delphi whether Demaratos was the son of Ariston. The question then having been referred by the arrangement of Cleomenes to the Pythian prophetess  thereupon Cleomenes gained over to his side Cobon the son of Aristophantos  who had most power among the Delphians  and Cobin persuaded Perialla the prophetess of the Oracle to say that which Cleomenes desired to have said. Thus the Pythian prophetess  when those who were sent to consult the god asked her their question  gave decision that Demaratos was not the son of Ariston. Afterwards however these things became known  and both Cobon went into exile from Delphi and Perialla the prophetess of the Oracle was removed from her office.,mashup

With regard to the deposing of Demaratos from the kingdom it happened thus: but Demaratos became an exile from Sparta to the Medes on account of a reproach which here follows:— After he had been deposed from the kingdom Demaratos was holding a public office to which he had been elected. Now it was the time of the Gymnopaidiai; and as Demaratos was a spectator of them  Leotychides  who had now become king himself instead of Demaratos  sent his attendant and asked Demaratos in mockery and insult what kind of a thing it was to be a magistrate after having been king; and he vexed at the question made answer and said that he himself had now had experience of both  but Leotychides had not; this question however  he said  would be the beginning either of countless evil or countless good fortune for the Lacedemonians. Having thus said  he veiled his head and went forth out of the theatre to his own house; and forthwith he made preparations and sacrificed an ox to Zeus  and after having sacrificed he called his mother.,mashup

I therefore entreat thee by the gods to tell me the truth; for if thou hast done any of these things which are reported  thou hast not done them alone  but with many other women; and the report is commonly believed in Sparta that there was not in Ariston seed which should beget children; for if so  then his former wives also would have borne children.,mashup

Thus he spoke  and she made answer as follows:My son  since thou dost beseech me with entreaties to speak the truth  the whole truth shall be told to thee. When Ariston had brought me into his house  on the third night there came to me an apparition in the likeness of Ariston  and having lain with me it put upon me the garlands which it had on; and the apparition straitway departed  and after this Ariston came; and when he saw me with garlands  he asked who it was who had given me them; and I said that he had given them  but he did not admit it; and I began to take oath of it  saying that he did not well to deny it  for he had come (I said ) a short time before and had lain with me and given me the garlands. Then Ariston  seeing that I made oath of it  perceived that the matter was of the gods; and first the garlands were found to be from the hero-temple which stands by the outer door of the house  which they call the temple of Astrabacos  and secondly the diviners gave answer that it was this same hero. Thus  my son  thou hast all  as much as thou desirest to learn; for either thou art begotten of this hero and the hero Astrabacos is thy father  or Ariston is thy father  for on that night I conceived thee: but as to that wherein thy foes most take hold of thee  saying that Ariston himself  when thy birth was announced to him  in the hearing of many declared that thou wert not his son  because the time  the ten months namely  had not yet been fulfilled  in ignorance of such matters he cast forth that saying; for women bring forth children both at the ninth month and also at the seventh  and not all after they have completed ten months; and I bore thee  my son  at the seventh month: and Ariston himself also perceived after no long time that he had uttered this saying in folly. Do not thou then accept any other reports about thy begetting  for thou hast heard in all the full truth; but to Leotychides and to those who report these things may their wives bear children by keepers of asses!,mashup

Afterwards however  since those of Zakynthos refused to give him up  he passed over from thence to Asia  to the presence of king Dareios; and Dareios both received him with great honour as a guest  and also gave him land and cities. Thus Demaratos had come to Asia  and such was the fortune which he had had  having been distinguished in the estimation of the Lacedemonians in many other ways both by deeds and by counsels  and especially having gained for them an Olympic victory with the four-horse chariot  being the only one who achieved this of all the kings who ever arose in Sparta.,mashup

Demaratos being deposed  Leotychides the son of Menares succeeded to the kingdom; and he had born to him a son Zeuxidemos  whom some of the Spartans called Kyniscos. This Zeuxidemos did not become king of Sparta  for he died before Leotychides  leaving a son Archidemos: and Leotychides having lost Zeuxidemos married a second wife Eurydame  the sister of Menios and daughter of Diactorides  by whom he had no male issue  but a daughter Lampito  whom Archidemos the son of Zeuxidemos took in marriage  she being given to him by Leotychides.,mashup

Leotychides however did not himself live to old age in Sparta  but paid a retribution for Demaratos as follows:— he went as commander of the Lacedemonians to invade Thessaly  and when he might have reduced all to subjection  he accepted gifts of money amounting to a large sum; and being taken in the act there in the camp  as he was sitting upon a glove full of money  he was brought to trial and banished from Sparta  and his house was razed to the ground.

These things happened later; but at this time  when Cleomenes had brought to a successful issue the affair which concerned Demaratos  forthwith he took with him Leotychides and went against the Eginetans  being very greatly enraged with them because of their insults towards him. So the Eginetans on their part  since both the kings had come against them  thought fit no longer to resist; and the Spartans selected ten men who were the most considerable among the Eginetans both by wealth and by birth  and took them away as prisoners  and among others also Crios the son of Polycritos and Casambos the son of Aristocrates  who had the greatest power among them; and having taken these away to the land of Attica  they deposited them as a charge with the Athenians  who were the bitterest enemies of the Eginetans.,mashup

After this Cleomenes  since it had become known that he had devised evil against Demaratos  was seized by fear of the Spartans and retired to Thessaly. Thence he came to Arcadia  and began to make mischief and to combine the Arcadians against Sparta; and besides other oaths with which he caused them to swear that they would assuredly follow him whithersoever he should lead them  he was very desirous also to bring the chiefs of the Arcadians to the city of Nonacris and cause them to swear by the water of Styx; for near this city it is said by the Arcadians that there is the water of Styx  and there is in fact something of this kind: a small stream of water is seen to trickle down from a rock into a hollow ravine  and round the ravine runs a wall of rough stones. Now Nonacris  where it happens that this spring is situated  is a city of Arcadia near Pheneos.,mashup

The Lacedemonians  hearing that Cleomenes was acting thus  were afraid  and proceeded to bring him back to Sparta to rule on the same terms as before: but when he had come back  forthwith a disease of madness seized him (who had been even before this somewhat insane )  and whenever he met any of the Spartans  he dashed his staff against the man's face. And as he continued to do this and had gone quite out of his senses  his kinsmen bound him in stocks. Then being so bound  and seeing his warder left alone by the rest  he asked him for a knife; and the warder not being at first willing to give it  he threatened him with that which he would do to him afterwards if he did not; until at last the warder fearing the threats  for he was one of the Helots  gave him a knife. Then Cleomenes  when he had received the steel  began to maltreat himself from the legs upwards: for he went on cutting his flesh lengthways from the legs to the thighs and from the thighs to the loins and flanks  until at last he came to the belly; and cutting this into strips he died in that manner. And this happened  as most of the Hellenes report  because he persuaded the Pythian prophetess to advise that which was done about Demaratos; but as the Athenians alone report  it was because when he invaded Eleusis he laid waste the sacred enclosure of the goddesses; and according to the report of the Argives  because from their sanctuary dedicated to Argos he caused to come down those of the Argives who had fled for refuge from the battle and slew them  and also set fire to the grove itself  holding it in no regard.,mashup

For when Cleomenes was consulting the Oracle at Delphi  the answer was given him that he should conquer Argos; so he led the Spartans and came to the river Erasinos  which is said to flow from the Stymphalian lake; for this lake  they say  running out into a viewless chasm  appears again above ground in the land of Argos; and from thence onwards this water is called by the Argives Erasinos: having come  I say  to this river  Cleomenes did sacrifice to it; and since the sacrifices were not at all favourable for him to cross over  he said that he admired the Erasinos for not betraying the men of its country  but the Argives should not even so escape. After this he retired back from thence and led his army down to Thyrea; and having done sacrifice to the Sea by slaying a bull  he brought them in ships to the land of Tiryns and Nauplia.,mashup

Being informed of this  the Argives came to the rescue towards the sea; and when they had got near Tiryns and were at the place which is called Hesipeia  they encamped opposite to the Lacedemonians leaving no very wide space between the armies. There the Argives were not afraid of the open fighting  but only lest they should be conquered by craft; for to this they thought referred the oracle which the Pythian prophetess gave in common to these and to the Milesians  saying as follows:But when the female at length shall conquer the male in the battle  Conquer and drive him forth  and glory shall gain among Argives  Then many wives of the Argives shall tear both cheeks in their mourning; So that a man shall say some time  of the men that came after  'Quelled by the spear it perished  the three-coiled terrible serpent ' The conjunction of all these things caused fear to the Argives  and with a view to this they resolved to make use of the enemy's herald; and having so resolved they proceeded to do as follows:— whenever the Spartan herald proclaimed anything to the Lacedemonians  the Argives also did that same thing.,mashup

So Cleomenes  perceiving that the Argives were doing whatever the herald of the Lacedemonians proclaimed  passed the word to the Lacedemonians that when the herald should proclaim that they were to get breakfast  then they should take up their arms and go to attack the Argives. This was carried out even so by the Lacedemonians; for as the Argives were getting breakfast according to the herald's proclamation  they attacked them; and many of them they slew  but many more yet took refuge in the sacred grove of Argos  and upon these they kept watch  sitting round about the place. Then Cleomenes did this which follows:,mashup

He had with him deserters  and getting information by inquiring of these  he sent a herald and summoned forth those of the Argives who were shut up in the sanctuary  mentioning each by name; and he summoned them forth saying that he had received their ransom. Now among the Peloponnesians ransom is two pounds weight of silver appointed to be paid for each prisoner. So Cleomenes summoned forth about fifty of the Argives one by one and slew them; and it chanced that the rest who were in the enclosure did not perceive that this was being done; for since the grove was thick  those within did not see how it fared with those who were without  at least until one of them climbed up a tree and saw from above that which was being done. Accordingly they then no longer came forth when they were called.,mashup

And when it was now burning  he asked one of the deserters to what god the grove was sacred  and the man replied that it was sacred to Argos.

Argos however was so bereft of men that their slaves took possession of all the State  ruling and managing it until the sons of those who had perished grew to be men. Then these  endeavouring to gain Argos back to themselves  cast them out; and the slaves being driven forth gained possession of Tiryns by fighting. Now for a time these two parties had friendly relations with one another; but afterwards there came to the slaves a prophet named Cleander  by race a Phigalian from Arcadia: this man persuaded the slaves to attack their masters  and in consequence of this there was war between them for a long time  until at last with difficulty the Argives overcame them.,mashup

The Argives then say that this was the reason why Cleomenes went mad and had an evil end: but the Spartans themselves say that Cleomenes was not driven mad by any divine power  but that he had become a drinker of unmixed wine from having associated with Scythians  and that he went mad in consequence of this: for the nomad Scythians  they say  when Dareios had made invasion of their land  desired eagerly after this to take vengeance upon him; and they sent to Sparta and tried to make an alliance  and to arrange that while the Scythians themselves attempted an invasion of Media by the way of the river Phasis  the Spartans should set forth from Ephesos and go up inland  and then that they should meet in one place: and they say that Cleomenes when the Scythians had come for this purpose  associated with them largely  and that thus associating more than was fit  he learnt the practice of drinking wine unmixed with water; and for this cause (as the Spartans think ) he went mad. Thenceforth  as they say themselves  when they desire to drink stronger wine  they sayFill up in Scythian fashion. Thus the Spartans report about Cleomenes; but to me it seems that this was a retribution which Cleomenes paid for Demaratos.,mashup

Now when the Eginetans heard that Cleomenes had met his end  they sent messengers to Sparta to denounce Leotychides for the matter of the hostages which were being kept at Athens: and the Lacedemonians caused a court to assemble and judged that the Eginetans had been dealt with outrageously by Leotychides; and they condemned him to be taken to Egina and delivered up in place of the men who were being kept at Athens. Then when the Eginetans were about to take Leotychides  Theasides the son of Leoprepes  a man of repute in Sparta  said to them:What are ye proposing to do  men of Egina? Do ye mean to take away the king of the Spartans  thus delivered up to you by his fellow-citizens? If the Spartans now being in anger have decided so  beware lest at some future time  if ye do this  they bring an evil upon your land which may destroy it. Hearing this the Eginetans abstained from taking him; but they came to an agreement that Leotychides should accompany them to Athens and restore the men to the Eginetans.,mashup

We Spartans report that there was in Lacedemon about two generations before my time on Glaucos the son of Epikydes. This man we say attained the highest merit in all things besides  and especially he was well reported of by all who at that time dwelt in Lacedemon for his uprightness: and we relate that in due time it happened to him thus:— a man of Miletos came to Sparta and desired to have speech with him  alleging the reasons which follow: 'I am a Milesian ' he said  'and I am come hither desiring to have benefit from thy uprightness  Glaucos; for as there was much report of thy uprightness throughout all the rest of Hellas and also in Ionia  I considered with myself that Ionia is ever in danger  whereas Peloponnesus is safely established  and also that we never see wealth continue in the possession of the same persons long;— reflecting  I say  on these things and taking counsel with myself  I resolved to turn into money the half of my possessions  and to place it with thee  being well assured that if it were placed with thee I should have it safe. Do thou therefore  I pray thee  receive the money  and take and keep these tallies; and whosoever shall ask for the money back having the tokens answering to these  to him do thou restore it.' (b ) The stranger who had come from Miletos said so much; and Glaucos accepted the deposit on the terms proposed. Then after a long time had gone by  there came to Sparta the sons of him who had deposited the money with Glaucos; and they came to speech with Glaucos  and producing the tokens asked for the money to be given back: but he repulsed them answering them again thus: 'I do not remember the matter  nor does my mind bring back to me any knowledge of those things whereof ye speak; but I desire to recollect and do all that is just; for if I received it  I desire to restore it honestly; and if on the other hand I did not receive it at all  I will act towards you in accordance with the customs of the Hellenes: therefore I defer the settling of the matter with you for three months from now.' (c ) The Milesians accordingly went away grieved  for they supposed that they had been robbed of the money; but Glaucos set forth to Delphi to consult the Oracle: and when he inquired of the Oracle whether he should rob them of the money by an oath  the Pythian prophetess rebuked him with these lines:'Glaucos  thou  Epikydes' son  yea  this for the moment  This  to conquer their word by an oath and to rob  is more gainful. Swear  since the lot of death waits also for him who swears truly. But know thou that Oath has a son  one nameless and handless and footless  Yet without feet he pursues  without hands he seizes  and wholly He shall destroy the race and the house of the man who offendeth. But for the man who swears truly his race is the better hereafter.' Having heard this Glaucos entreated that the god would pardon him for that which he had said  but the prophetess said that to make trial of the god and to do the deed were things equivalent. (d ) Glaucos then  having sent for the Milesians  gave back to them the money: but the reason for which  O Athenians  I set forth to relate to you this story  shall now be told. At the present time there is no descendant of Glaucos existing  nor any hearth which is esteemed to be that of Glaucos  but he has been utterly destroyed and rooted up out of Sparta. Thus it is good not even to entertain a thought about a deposit other than that of restoring it  when they who made it ask for it again.,mashup

When Leotychides had thus spoken  since not even so were the Athenians willing to listen to him  he departed back; and the Eginetans  before paying the penalty for their former wrongs wherein they did outrage to the Athenians to please the Thebans  acted as follows:— complaining of the conduct of the Athenians and thinking that they were being wronged  they made preparations to avenge themselves upon the Athenians; and since the Athenians were celebrating a four-yearly festival at Sunion  they lay in wait for the sacred ship which was sent to it and took it  the vessel being full of men who were the first among the Athenians; and having taken it they laid the men in bonds.,mashup

And there was in Egina a man of repute  one Nicodromos the son of Cnithos: this man had cause of complaint against the Eginetans for having before this driven him forth out of the island; and hearing now that the Athenians had resolved to do mischief to the Eginetans  he agreed with the Athenians to deliver up Egina to them  telling them on what day he would make his attempt and by what day it would be necessary for them to come to his assistance.,mashup

After this Nicodromos  according as he had agreed with the Athenians  seized that which is called the old city  but the Athenians did not come to his support at the proper time; for  as it chanced  they had not ships sufficient to fight with the Eginetans; so while they were asking the Corinthians to lend them ships  during this time their cause went to ruin. The Corinthians however  being at this time exceedingly friendly with them  gave the Athenians twenty ships at their request; and these they gave by selling them at five drachmas apiece  for by the law it was not permitted to give them as a free gift. Having taken these ships of which I speak and also their own  the Athenians with seventy ships manned in all sailed to Egina  and they were later by one day than the time agreed.,mashup

This happened afterwards: but at the time of which we speak the well-to-do class among the Eginetans prevailed over the men of the people  who had risen against them in combination with Nicodromos  and then having got them into their power they were bringing their prisoners forth to execution. From this there came upon them a curse which they were not able to expiate by sacrifice  though they devised against it all they could; but they were driven forth from the island before the goddess became propitious to them. For they had taken as prisoners seven hundred of the men of the people and were bringing them forth to execution  when one of them escaped from his bonds and fled for refuge to the entrance of the temple of Demeter the Giver of Laws  and he took hold of the latch of the door and clung to it; and when they found that they could not drag him from it by pulling him away  they cut off his hands and so carried him off  and those hands remained clinging to the latch of the door.,mashup

Thus did the Eginetans to one another: and when the Athenians came  they fought against them with seventy ships  and being worsted in the sea-fight they called to their assistance the same whom they had summoned before  namely the Argives. These would no longer come to their help  having cause of complaint because the ships of Egina compelled by Cleomenes had put in to the land of Argos and their crews had landed with the Lacedemonians; with whom also had landed men from ships of Sikyon in this same invasion: and as a penalty for this there was laid upon them by the Argives a fine of a thousand talents  five hundred for each State. The Sikyonians accordingly  acknowledging that they had committed a wrong  had made an agreement to pay a hundred talents and be free from the penalty; the Eginetans however did not acknowledge their wrong  but were more stubborn. For this reason then  when they made request  none of the Argives now came to their help at the charge of the State  but volunteers came to the number of a thousand; and their leader was a commander named Eurybates  a man who had practised the five contests. Of these men the greater number never returned back  but were slain by the Athenians in Egina; and the commander himself  Eurybates  fighting in single combat killed in this manner three men and was himself slain by the fourth  Sophanes namely of Dekeleia.,mashup

Mardonios then  since he had fared miserably in his expedition  he removed from his command; and appointing other generals to command he despatched them against Eretria and Athens  namely Datis  who was a Mede by race  and Artaphrenes the son of Artaphrenes  a nephew of the king: and he sent them forth with the charge to reduce Athens and Eretria to slavery and to bring the slaves back into his presence.,mashup

When these who had been appointed to command came in their march from the king to the Aleian plain in Kilikia  taking with them a large and well-equipped land-army  then while they were encamping there  the whole naval armament came up  which had been appointed for several nations to furnish; and there came to them also the ships for carrying horses  which in the year before Dareios had ordered his tributaries to make ready. In these they placed their horses  and having embarked the land-army in the ships they sailed for Ionia with six hundred triremes. After this they did not keep their ships coasting along the mainland towards the Hellespont and Thrace  but they started from Samos and made their voyage by the Icarian Sea and between the islands; because  as I think  they feared more than all else the voyage round Athos  seeing that in the former year while making the passage by this way they had come to great disaster. Moreover also Naxos compelled them  since it had not been conquered at the former time.,mashup

While these were doing thus  the Delians also had left Delos and fled away to Tenos; and when the armament was sailing in thither  Datis sailed on before and did not allow the ships to anchor at the island of Delos  but at Rhenaia on the other side of the channel; and he himself  having found out by inquiry where the men of Delos were  sent a herald and addressed them thus:Holy men  why are ye fled away and departed  having judged of me that which is not convenient? for even I of myself have wisdom at least so far  and moreover it has been thus commanded me by the king  not to harm at all that land in which the two divinities were born  neither the land itself nor the inhabitants of it. Now therefore return to your own possessions and dwell in your island. Thus he proclaimed by a herald to the Delians; and after this he piled up and burned upon the altar three hundred talents' weight of frankincense.,mashup

Datis having done these things sailed away with his army to fight against Eretria first  taking with him both Ionians and Aiolians; and after he had put out to sea from thence  Delos was moved  not having been shaken (as the Delians reported to me ) either before that time or since that down to my own time; and this no doubt the god manifested as a portent to men of the evils that were about to be; for in the time of Dareios the son of Hystaspes and Xerxes the son of Dareios and Artoxerxes the son of Xerxes  three generations following upon one another  there happened more evils to Hellas than during the twenty other generations which came before Dareios  some of the evils coming to it from the Persians  and others from the leaders themselves of Hellas warring together for supremacy. Thus it was not unreasonable that Delos should be moved  which was before unmoved. [And in an oracle it was thus written about it:Delos too will I move  unmoved though it hath been aforetime.] Now in the Hellenic tongue the names which have been mentioned have this meaning— Dareios meanscompeller  Xerxeswarrior  Artoxerxesgreat warrior. Thus then might the Hellenes rightly call these kings in their own tongue.,mashup

The Eretrians meanwhile being informed that the armament of the Persians was sailing to attack them  requested the Athenians to help them; and the Athenians did not refuse their support  but gave as helpers those four thousand to whom had been allotted the land of the wealthy Chalkidians. The Eretrians however  as it turned out  had no sound plan of action  for while they sent for the Athenians  they had in their minds two different designs: some of them  that is  proposed to leave the city and go to the heights of Euboea; while others of them  expecting to win gain for themselves from the Persian  were preparing to surrender the place. Having got knowledge of how things were as regards both these plans  Aischines the son of Nothon  one of the leaders of the Eretrians  told the whole condition of their affairs to those of the Athenians who had come  and entreated them to depart and go to their own land  that they might not also perish. So the Athenians did according to this counsel given to them by Aischines.,mashup

And while these passed over to Oropos and saved themselves  the Persians sailed on and brought their ships to land about Temenos and Chioreai and Aigilea in the Eretrian territory; and having taken possession of these places  forthwith they began to disembark their horses and prepared to advance against the enemy. The Eretrians however did not intend to come forth against them and fight; but their endeavour was if possible to hold out by defending their walls  since the counsel prevailed not to leave the city. Then a violent assault was made upon the wall  and for six days there fell many on both sides; but on the seventh day Euphorbos the son of Alkimachos and Philagros the son of Kyneos  men of repute among the citizens  gave up the city to the Persians. These having entered the city plundered and set fire to the temples in retribution for the temples which were burned at Sardis  and also reduced the people to slavery according to the commands of Dareios.,mashup

When the Athenians had information of this  they too went to Marathon to the rescue of their land; and they were led by ten generals  of whom the tenth was Miltiades  whose father Kimon of Stesagoras had been compelled to go into exile from Athens because of Peisistratos the son of Hippocrates: and while he was in exile it was his fortune to win a victory at the Olympic games with a four-horse chariot  wherein  as it happened  he did the same thing as his half-brother Miltiades had done  who had the same mother as he. Then afterwards in the next succeeding Olympic games he gained a victory with the same mares and allowed Peisistratos to be proclaimed as victor; and having resigned to him the victory he returned to his own native land under an agreement for peace. Then after he had won with the same mares at another Olympic festival  it was his hap to be slain by the sons of Peisistratos  Peisistratos himself being no longer alive. These killed him near the City Hall  having set men to lie in wait for him by night; and the burial-place of Kimon is in the outskirts of the city  on the other side of the road which is called the way through Coile  and just opposite him those mares are buried which won in three Olympic games. This same thing was done also by the mares belonging to Euagoras the Laconian  but besides these by none others. Now the elder of the sons of Kimon  Stesagoras  was at that time being brought up in the house of his father's brother Miltiades in the Chersonese  while the younger son was being brought up at Athens with Kimon himself  having been named Miltiades after Miltiades the settler of the Chersonese.,mashup

This Miltiades then at the time of which we speak had come from the Chersonese and was a general of the Athenians  after escaping death in two forms; for not only did the Phenicians  who had pursued after him as far as Imbros  endeavour earnestly to take him and bring him up to the presence of the king  but also after this  when he had escaped from these and had come to his own native land and seemed to be in safety from that time forth  his opponents  who had laid wait for him there  brought him up before a court and prosecuted him for his despotism in the Chersonese.

First of all  while they were still in the city  the generals sent off to Sparta a herald  namely Pheidippides an Athenian and for the rest a runner of long day-courses and one who practised this as his profession. With this man  as Pheidippides himself said and as he made report to the Athenians  Pan chanced to meet by mount Parthenion  which is above Tegea; and calling aloud the name of Pheidippides  Pan bade him report to the Athenians and ask for what reason they had no care of him  though he was well disposed to the Athenians and had been serviceable to them on many occasions before that time  and would be so also yet again. Believing that this tale was true  the Athenians  when their affairs had been now prosperously settled  established under the Acropolis a temple of Pan; and in consequence of this message they propitiate him with sacrifice offered every year and with a torch-race.,mashup

He  as I say  reported to them that with which he had been charged  and it pleased them well to come to help the Athenians; but it was impossible for them to do so at once  since they did not desire to break their law; for it was the ninth day of the month  and on the ninth day they said they would not go forth  nor until the circle of the moon should be full.,mashup

He conjectured then from the dream that he should return to Athens and recover his rule  and then bring his life to an end in old age in his own land. From the dream  I say  he conjectured this; and after this  as he guided them in  first he disembarked the slaves from Eretria on the island belonging to the Styrians  called Aigleia; and then  as the ships came in to shore at Marathon  he moored them there  and after the Barbarians had come from their ships to land  he was engaged in disposing them in their places. While he was ordering these things  it came upon him to sneeze and cough more violently than was his wont. Then since he was advanced in years  most of his teeth were shaken thereby  and one of these teeth he cast forth by the violence of the cough: and the tooth having fallen from him upon the sand  he was very desirous to find it; since however the tooth was not to be found when he searched  he groaned aloud and said to those who were by him:This land is not ours  nor shall we be able to make it subject to us; but so much part in it as belonged to me the tooth possesses.,mashup

Hippias then conjectured that his vision had been thus fulfilled: and meanwhile  after the Athenians had been drawn up in the sacred enclosure of Heracles  there joined them the Plataians coming to their help in a body: for the Plataians had given themselves to the Athenians  and the Athenians before this time undertook many toils on behalf of them; and this was the manner in which they gave themselves:— Being oppressed by the Thebans  the Plataians at first desired to give themselves to Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides and to the Lacedemonians  who chanced to come thither; but these did not accept them  and said to them as follows:We dwell too far off  and such support as ours would be to you but cold comfort; for ye might many times be reduced to slavery before any of us had information of it: but we counsel you rather to give yourselves to the Athenians  who are both neighbours and also not bad helpers. Thus the Lacedemonians counselled  not so much on account of their goodwill to the Plataians as because they desired that the Athenians should have trouble by being involved in a conflict with the Boetians. The Lacedemonians  I say  thus counselled the men of Plataia; and they did not fail to follow their counsel  but when the Athenians were doing sacrifice to the twelve gods  they sat down as suppliants at the altar and so gave themselves. Then the Thebans having been informed of these things marched against the Plataians  and the Athenians came to their assistance: and as they were about to join battle  the Corinthians did not permit them to do so  but being by chance there  they reconciled their strife; and both parties having put the matter into their hands  they laid down boundaries for the land  with the condition that the Thebans should leave those of the Boeotians alone who did not desire to be reckoned with the other Boeotians. The Corinthians having given this decision departed; but as the Athenians were going back  the Boeotians attacked them  and having attacked them they were worsted in the fight. Upon that the Athenians passed beyond the boundaries which the Corinthians had set to be for the Plataians  and they made the river Asopos itself to be the boundary of the Thebans towards the land of Plataia and towards the district of Hysiai. The Plataians then had given themselves to the Athenians in the manner which has been said  and at this time they came to Marathon to bring them help.,mashup

Now the opinions of the generals of the Athenians were divided  and the one party urged that they should not fight a battle  seeing that they were too few to fight with the army of the Medes  while the others  and among them Miltiades  advised that they should do so: and when they were divided and the worse opinion was like to prevail  then  since he who had been chosen by lot to be polemarch of the Athenians had a vote in addition to the ten (for in old times the Athenians gave the polemarch an equal vote with the generals ) and at that time the polemarch was Callimachos of the deme of Aphidnai  to him came Miltiades and said as follows:With thee now it rests  Callimachos  either to bring Athens under slavery  or by making her free to leave behind thee for all the time that men shall live a memorial such as not even Harmodios and Aristogeiton have left. For now the Athenians have come to a danger the greatest to which they have ever come since they were a people; and on the one hand  if they submit to the Medes  it is determined what they shall suffer  being delivered over to Hippias  while on the other hand  if this city shall gain the victory  it may become the first of the cities of Hellas. How this may happen and how it comes to thee of all men to have the decision of these matters  I am now about to tell. Of us the generals  who are ten in number  the opinions are divided  the one party urging that we fight a battle and the others that we do not fight. Now if we do not  I expect that some great spirit of discord will fall upon the minds of the Athenians and so shake them that they shall go over to the Medes; but if we fight a battle before any unsoundness appear in any part of the Athenian people  then we are able to gain the victory in the fight  if the gods grant equal conditions. These things then all belong to thee and depend on thee; for if thou attach thyself to my opinions  thou hast both a fatherland which is free and a native city which shall be the first among the cities of Hellas; but if thou choose the opinion of those who are earnest against fighting  thou shalt have the opposite of those good things of which I told thee.,mashup

And when it came round to him  then the Athenians were drawn up for battle in the order which here follows:— On the right wing the polemarch Callimachos was leader (for the custom of the Athenians then was this  that the polemarch should have the right wing ); and he leading  next after him came the tribes in order as they were numbered one after another  and last were drawn up the Plataians occupying the left wing: for ever since this battle  when the Athenians offer sacrifices in the solemn assemblies which are made at the four-yearly festivals  the herald of the Athenians prays thus that blessings may come to the Athenians and to the Plataians both. On this occasion however  when the Athenians were being drawn up at Marathon something of this kind was done:— their army being made equal in length of front to that of the Medes  came to drawn up in the middle with a depth of but few ranks  and here their army was weakest  while each wing was strengthened with numbers.,mashup

And when they had been arranged in their places and the sacrifices proved favourable  then the Athenians were let go  and they set forth at a run to attack the Barbarians. Now the space between the armies was not less than eight furlongs: and the Persians seeing them advancing to the attack at a run  made preparations to receive them; and in their minds they charged the Athenians with madness which must be fatal  seeing that they were few and yet were pressing forwards at a run  having neither cavalry nor archers. Such was the thought of the Barbarians; but the Athenians when all in a body they had joined in combat with the Barbarians  fought in a memorable fashion: for they were the first of all the Hellenes about whom we know who went to attack the enemy at a run  and they were the first also who endured to face the Median garments and the men who wore them  whereas up to this time the very name of the Medes was to the Hellenes a terror to hear.,mashup

Now while they fought in Marathon  much time passed by; and in the centre of the army  where the Persians themselves and the Sacans were drawn up  the Barbarians were winning — here  I say  the Barbarians had broken the ranks of their opponents and were pursuing them inland  but on both wings the Athenians and the Plataians severally were winning the victory; and being victorious they left that part of the Barbarians which had been routed to fly without molestation  and bringing together the two wings they fought with those who had broken their centre  and the Athenians were victorious. So they followed after the Persians as they fled  slaughtering them  until they came to the sea; and then they called for fire and began to take hold of the ships.,mashup

Now it is a cause of wonder to me  and I do not accept the report  that the Alcmaionidai could ever have displayed to the Persians a shield by a previous understanding  with the desire that the Athenians should be under the Barbarians and under Hippias; seeing that they are evidently proved to have been haters of despots as much or more than Callias the son of Phainippos and father of Hipponicos  while Callias for his part was the only man of all the Athenians who dared  when Peisistratos was driven out of Athens  to buy his goods offered for sale by the State  and in other ways also he contrived against him everything that was most hostile: [,mashup

Therefore this is a cause of wonder to me  and I do not admit the accusation that these they were who displayed the shield; seeing that they were in exile from the despots during their whole time  and that by their contrivance the sons of Peisistratos gave up their rule. Thus it follows that they were the men who set Athens free much more than Harmodios and Aristogeiton  as I judge: for these my slaying Hipparchos exasperated the rest of the family of Peisistratos  and did not at all cause the others to cease from their despotism; but the Alcmaionidai did evidently set Athens free  at least if these were in truth the men who persuaded the Pythian prophetess to signify to the Lacedemonians that they should set Athens free  as I have set forth before.,mashup

For first Alcmaion the son of Megacles showed himself a helper of the Lydians from Sardis who came from Croesus to the Oracle at Delphi  and assisted them with zeal; and Croesus having heard from the Lydians who went to the Oracle that this man did him service  sent for him to Sardis; and when he came  he offered to give him a gift of as much gold as he could carry away at once upon his own person. With a view to this gift  its nature being such  Alcmaion made preparations and used appliances as follows:— he put on a large tunic leaving a deep fold in the tunic to hang down in front  and he draw on his feet the widest boots which he could find  and so went to the treasury to which they conducted him. Then he fell upon a heap of gold-dust  and first he packed in by the side of his legs so much of the gold as his boots would contain  and then he filled the whole fold of the tunic with the gold and sprinkled some of the gold dust on the hair of his head and took some into his mouth  and having so done he came forth out of the treasury  with difficulty dragging along his boots and resembling anything in the world rather than a man; for his mouth was stuffed full  and every part of him was swelled out: and upon Croesus came laughter when he saw him  and he not only gave him all that  but also presented him in addition with more not inferior in value to that. Thus this house became exceedingly wealthy  and thus the Alcmaion of whom I speak became a breeder of chariot-horses and won a victory at Olympia.,mashup

Then in the next generation after this  Cleisthenes the despot of Sikyon exalted the family  so that it became of much more note among the Hellenes than it had been formerly. For Cleisthenes the son of Arisonymos  the son of Myron  the son of Andreas  had a daughter whose name was Agariste; and as to her he formed a desire to find out the best man of all the Hellenes and to assign her to him in marriage. So when the Olympic games were being held and Cleisthenes was victor in them with a four- horse chariot  he caused a proclamation to be made  that whosoever of the Hellenes thought himself worthy to be the son-in-law of Cleisthenes should come on the sixtieth day  or before that if he would  to Sikyon; for Cleisthenes intended to conclude the marriage within a year  reckoning from the sixtieth day. Then all those of the Hellenes who had pride either in themselves or in their high descent  came as wooers  and for them Cleisthenes had a running- course and a wrestling-place made and kept them expressly for their use.,mashup

After the defeat at Marathon  Miltiades  who even before was well reputed with the Athenians  came then to be in much higher estimation: and when he asked the Athenians for seventy ships and an army with supplies of money  not declaring to them against what land he was intending to make an expedition  but saying that he would enrich them greatly if they would go with him  for he would lead them to a land of such a kind that they would easily get from it gold in abundance — thus saying he asked for the ships; and the Athenians  elated by these words  delivered them over to him.,mashup

So when Miltiades had arrived at the place to which he was sailing  he began to besiege the Parians with his army  first having shut them up within their wall; and sending in to them a herald he asked for a hundred talents  saying that if they refused to give them  his army should not return back until it had conquered them completely. The Parians however had no design of giving any money to Miltiades  but contrived only how they might defend their city  devising various things besides and also this — wherever at any time the wall proved to be open to attack  that point was raised when night came on to double its former height.,mashup

So much of the story is reported by all the Hellenes  but as to what followed the Parians alone report  and they say that it happened thus:— When Miltiades was at a loss  it is said  there came a woman to speech with him  who had been taken prisoner  a Parian by race whose name was Timo  an under-priestess of the Earth goddesses; she  they say  came into the presence of Miltiades and counselled him that if he considered it a matter of much moment to conquer Paros  he could do that which she should suggest to him; and upon that she told him her meaning. He accordingly passed through to the hill which is before the city and leapt over the fence of the temple of Demeter Giver of Laws  not being able to open the door; and then having leapt over he went on towards the sanctuary with the design of doing something within  whether it were that he meant to lay hands on some of the things which should not be touched  or whatever else he intended to do; and when he had reached the door  forthwith a shuddering fear came over him and he set off to go back the same way as he came  and as he leapt down from the wall of rough stones his thigh was dislocated  or  as others say  he struck his knee against the wall.,mashup

Miltiades accordingly  being in a wretched case  set forth to sail homewards  neither bringing wealth to the Athenians nor having added to them the possession of Paros  but having besieged the city for six-and-twenty days and laid waste the island: and the Parians being informed that Timo the under-priestess of the goddesses had acted as a guide to Miltiades  desired to take vengeance upon her for this  and they sent messengers to Delphi to consult the god  so soon as they had leisure from the siege; and these messengers they sent to ask whether they should put to death the under-priestess of the goddesses  who had been a guide to their enemies for the capture of her native city and had revealed to Miltiades the mysteries which might not be uttered to a male person. The Pythian prophetess however forbade them  saying that Timo was not the true author of these things  but since it was destined that Miltiades should end his life not well  she had appeared to guide him to his evil fate.,mashup

Thus the Pythian prophetess replied to the Parians: and the Athenians  when Miltiades had returned back from Paros  began to talk of him  and among the rest especially Xanthippos the son of Ariphron  who brought Miltiades up before the people claiming the penalty of death and prosecuted him for his deception of the Athenians: and Miltiades did not himself make his own defence  although he was present  for he was unable to do so because his thigh was mortifying; but he lay in public view upon a bed  while his friends made a defence for him  making mention much both of the battle which had been fought at Marathon and of the conquest of Lemnos  namely how he had conquered Lemnos and taken vengeance on the Pelasgians  and had delivered it over to the Athenians: and the people came over to his part as regards the acquittal from the penalty of death  but they imposed a fine of fifty talents for the wrong committed: and after this Miltiades died  his thigh having gangrened and mortified  and the fifty talents were paid by his son Kimon.,mashup

Now Miltiades son of Kimon had thus taken possession of the Lemnos:— After the Pelasgians had been cast out of Attica by the Athenians  whether justly or unjustly — for about this I cannot tell except the things reported  which are these:— Hecataois on the one hand  the son of Hegesander  said in his history that it was done unjustly; for he said that when the Athenians saw the land which extends below Hymettos  which they had themselves given them to dwell in  as payment for the wall built round the Acropolis in former times  when the Athenians  I say  saw that this land was made good by cultivation  which before was bad and worthless  they were seized with jealousy and with longing to possess the land  and so drove them out  not alleging any other pretext: but according to the report of the Athenians themselves they drove them out justly; for the Pelasgians being settled under Hymettos made this a starting-point and committed wrong against them as follows:— the daughters and sons of the Athenians were wont ever to go for water to the spring of Enneacrunos; for at that time neither they nor the other Hellenes as yet had household servants; and when these girls came  the Pelasgians in wantonness and contempt of the Athenians would offer them violence; and it was not enough for them even to do this  but at last they were found in the act of plotting an attack upon the city: and the narrators say that they herein proved themselves better men than the Pelasgians  inasmuch as when they might have slain the Pelasgians  who had been caught plotting against them  they did not choose to do so  but ordered them merely to depart out of the land: and thus having departed out of the land  the Pelasgians took possession of several older places and especially of Lemnos. The former story is that which was reported by Hecataios  while the latter is that which is told by the Athenians.,mashup

These Pelasgians then  dwelling after that in Lemnos  desired to take vengeance on the Athenians; and having full knowledge also of the festivals of the Athenians  they got fifty- oared galleys and laid wait for the women of the Athenians when they were keeping festival to Artemis in Brauron; and having carried off a number of them from thence  they departed and sailed away home  and taking the women to Lemnos they kept them as concubines. Now when these women had children gradually more and more  they made it their practice to teach their sons both the Attic tongue and the manners of the Athenians. And these were not willing to associate with the sons of the Pelasgian women  and moreover if any of them were struck by any one of those  they all in a body came to the rescue and helped one another. Moreover the boys claimed to have authority over the other boys and got the better of them easily. Perceiving these things the Pelasgians considered the matter; and when they took counsel together  a fear came over them and they thought  if the boys were indeed resolved now to help one another against the sons of the legitimate wives  and were endeavouring already from the first to have authority over them  what would they do when they were grown up to be men? Then they determined to put to death the sons of the Athenian women  and this they actually did; and in addition to them they slew their mothers also. From this deed and from that which was done before this  which the women did when they killed Thoas and the rest  who were their own husbands  it has become a custom in Hellas that all deeds of great cruelty should be calledLemnian deeds.,mashup

After the Pelasgians had killed their own sons and wives  the earth did not bear fruit for them  nor did their women or their cattle bring forth young as they did before; and being hard pressed by famine and by childlessness  they sent to Delphi to ask for a release from the evils which were upon them; and the Pythian prophetess bade them pay such penalty to the Athenians as the Athenians themselves should appoint. The Pelasgians came accordingly to Athens and professed that they were willing to pay the penalty for all the wrong which they had done: and the Athenians laid a couch in the fairest possible manner in the City Hall  and having set by it a table covered with all good things  they bade the Pelasgians deliver up to them their land in that condition. Then the Pelasgians answered and said:When with a North Wind in one single day a ship shall accomplish the voyage from your land to ours  then we will deliver it up  feeling assured that it was impossible for this to happen  since Attica lies far away to the South of Lemnos.,mashup

Such were the events which happened then: and very many years later  after the Chersonese which is by the Hellespont had come to be under the Athenians  Miltiades the son of Kimon  when the Etesian Winds blew steadily  accomplished the voyage in a ship from Elaius in the Chersonese to Lemnos  and proclaimed to the Pelasgians that they should depart out of the island  reminding them of the oracle  which the Pelasgians had never expected would be accomplished for them. The men of Hephaistia accordingly obeyed; but those of Myrina  not admitting that the Chersonese was Attica  suffered a siege  until at last these also submitted. Thus it was that the Athenians and Miltiades took possession of Lemnos.,mashup

Now when the report came to Dareios the son of Hystaspes of the battle which was fought at Marathon  the king  who even before this had been greatly exasperated with the Athenians on account of the attack made upon Sardis  then far more than before displayed indignation  and was far more desirous of making a march against Hellas. Accordingly at once he sent messengers to the various cities and ordered that they should get ready a force  appointing to each people to supply much more than at the former time  and not only ships of war  but also horses and provisions and transport vessels; and when these commands were carried round  all Asia was moved for three years  for all the best men were being enlisted for the expedition against Hellas  and were making preparations. In the fourth year however the Egyptians  who had been reduced to subjection by Cambyses  revolted from the Persians; and then he was even more desirous of marching against both these nations.,mashup

While Dareios was thus preparing to set out against Egypt and against Athens  there arose a great strife among his sons about the supreme power; and they said that he must not make his expeditions until he had designated one of them to be king  according to the custom of the Persians. For to Dareios already before he became king three sons had been born of his former wife the daughter of Gobryas  and after he became king four other sons of Atossa the daughter of Cyrus: of the first the eldest was Artobazanes  and of those who had been born later  Xerxes. These being not of the same mother were at strife with one another  Artobazanes contending that he was the eldest of all the sons  and that it was a custom maintained by all men that the eldest should have the rule  and Xerxes arguing that he was the son of Atossa the daughter of Cyrus  and that Cyrus was he who had won for the Persians their freedom.,mashup

Now while Dareios did not as yet declare his judgment  it chanced that Demaratos also  the son of Ariston  had come up to Susa at this very same time  having been deprived of the kingdom in Sparta and having laid upon himself a sentence of exile from Lacedemon. This man  hearing of the difference between the sons of Dareios  came (as it is reported of him ) and counselled Xerxes to say in addition to those things which he was wont to say  that he had been born to Dareios at the time when he was already reigning as king and was holding the supreme power over the Persians  while Artobazanes had been born while Dareios was still in a private station: it was not fitting therefore nor just that another should have the honour before him; for even in Sparta  suggested Demaratos  this was the custom  that is to say  if some of the sons had been born first  before their father began to reign  and another came after  born later while he was reigning  the succession of the kingdom belonged to him who had been born later. Xerxes accordingly made use of the suggestion of Demaratos; and Dareios perceiving that he spoke that which was just  designated him to be king. It is my opinion however that even without this suggestion Xerxes would have become king  for Atossa was all-powerful.,mashup

Dareios being dead the kingdom passed to his son Xerxes. Now Xerxes at the first was by no means anxious to make a march against Hellas  but against Egypt he continued to gather a force. Mardonios however  the son of Gobryas  who was a cousin of Xerxes  being sister's son to Dareios  was ever at his side  and having power with him more than any other of the Persians  he kept continually to such discourse as this which follows  saying:Master  it is not fitting that the Athenians  after having done to the Persians very great evil  should not pay the penalty for that which they have done. What if thou shouldest at this present time do that which thou hast in thy hands to do; and when thou hast tamed the land of Egypt  which has broken out insolently against us  then do thou march an army against Athens  that a good report may be made of thee by men  and that in future every one may beware of making expeditions against thy land. Thus far his speech had to do with vengeance  and to this he would make addition as follows  saying that Europe was a very fair land and bore all kinds of trees that are cultivated for fruit  and was of excellent fertility  and such that the king alone of all mortals was worthy to possess it.,mashup

These things he was wont to say  since he was one who had a desire for perilous enterprise and wished to be himself the governor of Hellas under the king. So in time he prevailed upon Xerxes and persuaded him to do this; for other things also assisted him and proved helpful to him in persuading Xerxes. In the first place there had come from Thessaly messengers sent by the Aleuadai  who were inviting the king to come against Hellas and were showing great zeal in his cause  (now these Aleuadai were kings of Thessaly ): and then secondly those of the sons of Peisistratos who had come up to Susa were inviting him also  holding to the same arguments as the Aleuadai; and moreover they offered him yet more inducement in addition to these; for there was one Onomacritos an Athenian  who both uttered oracles and also had collected and arranged the oracles of Musaios; and with this man they had come up  after they had first reconciled the enmity between them. For Onomacritos had been driven forth from Athens by Hipparchos the son of Peisistratos  having been caught by Lasos of Hermion interpolating in the works of Musaios an oracle to the effect that the islands which lie off Lemnos should disappear under the sea. For this reason Hipparchos drove him forth  having before this time been very much wont to consult him. Now however he had gone up with them; and when he had come into the presence of the king  the sons of Peisistratos spoke of him in magnificent terms  and he repeated some of the oracles; and if there was in them anything which imported disaster to the Barbarians  of this he said nothing; but choosing out of them the most fortunate things he told how it was destined that the Hellespont should be yoked with a bridge by a Persian  and he set forth the manner of the march. He then thus urged Xerxes with oracles  while the sons of Peisistratos and the Aleuadai pressed him with their advice.,mashup

So when Xerxes had been persuaded to make an expedition against Hellas  then in the next year after the death of Dareios he made a march first against those who had revolted. Having subdued these and having reduced all Egypt to slavery much greater than it had suffered in the reign of Dareios  he entrusted the government of it to Achaimenes his own brother  a son of Dareios. Now this Achaimenes being a governor of Egypt was slain afterwards by Inaros the son of Psammetichos  a Libyan.,mashup

Now about the nations which Cyrus and Cambyses and my father Dareios subdued and added to their possessions there is no need for me to speak  since ye know well: and as for me  from the day when I received by inheritance this throne upon which I sit I carefully considered always how in this honourable place I might not fall short of those who have been before me  nor add less power to the dominion of the Persians: and thus carefully considering I find a way by which not only glory may be won by us  together with a land not less in extent nor worse than that which we now possess  (and indeed more varied in its productions )  but also vengeance and retribution may be brought about.

And yet it is true that the Hellenes make wars  but (as I am informed ) very much without wise consideration  by reason of obstinacy and want of skill: for when they have proclaimed war upon one another  they find out first the fairest and smoothest place  and to this they come down and fight; so that even the victors depart from the fight with great loss  and as to the vanquished  of them I make no mention at all  for they are utterly destroyed. They ought however  being men who speak the same language  to make use of heralds and messengers and so to take up their differences and settle them in any way rather than by battles; but if they must absolutely war with one another  they ought to find out each of them that place in which they themselves are hardest to overcome  and here to make their trial.

However that may be  let not anything be left untried; for nothing comes of itself  but from trial all things are wont to come to men.,mashup

Mardonios having thus smoothed over the resolution expressed by Xerxes had ceased speaking: and when the other Persians were silent and did not venture to declare an opinion contrary to that which had been proposed  then Artabanos the son of Hystaspes  being father's brother to Xerxes and having reliance upon that  spoke as follows: O king  if opinions opposed to one another be not spoken  it is not possible to select the better in making the choice  but one must accept that which has been spoken; if however opposite opinions be uttered  this is possible; just as we do not distinguish the gold which is free from alloy when it is alone by itself  but when we rub it on the touchstone in comparison with other gold  then we distinguish that which is the better. Now I gave advice to thy father Dareios also  who was my brother  not to march against the Scythians  men who occupied no abiding city in any part of the earth. He however  expecting that he would subdue the Scythians who were nomads  did not listen to me; but he made a march and came back from it with the loss of many good men of his army. But thou  O king  art intending to march against men who are much better than the Scythians  men who are reported to be excellent both by sea and on land: and the thing which is to be feared in this matter it is right that I should declare to thee. ,mashup

Not however by any native wisdom of my own do I conjecture that this might happen: I am conjecturing only such a misfortune as all but came upon us at the former time  when thy father  having yoked the Bosphorus of Thracia and made a bridge over the river Ister  had crossed over to go against the Scythians. At that time the Scythians used every means of entreaty to persuade the Ionians to break up the passage  to whom it had been entrusted to guard the bridges of the Ister. At that time  if Histiaios the despot of Miletos had followed the opinion of the other despots and had not made opposition to them  the power of the Persians would have been brought to an end. Yet it is a fearful thing even to hear it reported that the whole power of the king had come to depend upon one human creature. ,mashup

Let not this be so; for slander is a most grievous thing: in it the wrongdoers are two  and the person who suffers wrong is one. The slanderer does a wrong in that he speaks against one who is not present  the other in that he is persuaded of the thing before he gets certain knowledge of it  and he who is not present when the words are spoken suffers wrong in the matter thus — both because he has been slandered by the one and because he has been believed to be bad by the other. ,mashup

However  if it be absolutely needful to make an expedition against these men  come  let the king himself remain behind in the abodes of the Persians  and let us both set to the wager our sons; and then do thou lead an army by thyself  choosing for thyself the men whom thou desirest  and taking an army as large as thou thinkest good: and if matters turn out for the king as thou sayest  let my sons be slain and let me also be slain in addition to them; but if in the way which I predict  let thy sons suffer this  and with them thyself also  if thou shalt return back. But if thou art not willing to undergo this proof  but wilt by all means lead an army against Hellas  then I say that those who are left behind in this land will hear that Mardonios  after having done a great mischief to the Persians  is torn by dogs and birds  either in the land of the Athenians  or else perchance thou wilt be in the land of the Lacedemonians (unless indeed this should have come to pass even before that upon the way )  and that thou hast at length been made aware against what kind of men thou art persuading the king to march.,mashup

Artabanos thus spoke; and Xerxes enraged by it made answer as follows:Artabanos  thou art my father's brother  and this shall save thee from receiving any recompense such as thy foolish words deserve. Yet I attach to thee this dishonour  seeing that thou art a coward and spiritless  namely that thou do not march with me against Hellas  but remain here together with the women; and I  even without thy help  will accomplish all the things which I said: for I would I might not be descended from Dareios  the son of Hystaspes  the son of Arsames  the son of Ariaramnes  the son of Teispes  or from Cyrus  the son of Cambyses  the son of Teispes  the son of Achaimenes  if I take not vengeance on the Athenians; since I know well that if we shall keep quiet  yet they will not do so  but will again march against our land  if we may judge by the deeds which have been done by them to begin with  since they both set fire to Sardis and marched upon Asia. It is not possible therefore that either side should retire from the quarrel  but the question before us is whether we shall do or whether we shall suffer; whether all these regions shall come to be under the Hellenes or all those under the Persians: for in our hostility there is no middle course. It follows then now that it is well for us  having suffered wrong first  to take revenge  that I may find out also what is this terrible thing which I shall suffer if I lead an army against these men — men whom Pelops the Phrygian  who was the slave of my forefathers  so subdued that even to the present day both the men themselves and their land are called after the name of him who subdued them.,mashup

Thou dost not well in changing thy counsel  nor will he who is here present with thee excuse thee from it; but as thou didst take counsel in the day to do  by that way go.,mashup

After he had said this  Xerxes thought that he who had spoken flew away; and when day had dawned he made no account of this dream  but gathered together the Persians whom he had assembled also the former time and said to them these words:Persians  pardon me that I make quick changes in my counsel; for in judgment not yet am I come to my prime  and they who advise me to do the things which I said  do not for any long time leave me to myself. However  although at first when I heard the opinion of Artabanos my youthful impulses burst out  so that I cast out unseemly words against a man older than myself; yet now I acknowledge that he is right  and I shall follow his opinion.

I am not able however to do them  although I desire it; for indeed  now that I have turned about and changed my mind  a dream appears haunting me and by no means approving that I should do so; and just now it has left me even with a threat.

It is equally good in my judgment  O king  whether a man has wisdom himself or is willing to follow the counsel of him who speaks well: and thou  who hast attained to both these good things  art caused to err by the communications of evil men; just as they say that the Sea  which is of all things the most useful to men  is by blasts of winds falling upon it prevented from doing according to its own nature. I however  when I was evil spoken of by thee  was not so much stung with pain for this  as because  when two opinions were laid before the Persians  the one tending to increase wanton insolence and the other tending to check it and saying that it was a bad thing to teach the soul to endeavour always to have something more than the present possession — because  I say  when such opinions as these were laid before us  thou didst choose that one which was the more dangerous both for thyself and for the Persians. ,mashup

But supposing that it desires to appear to me at all  it is not bound to appear to me any the more if I have thy garments on me than if I have my own  nor any more if I take my rest in thy bed than if I am in thy own; for assuredly this thing  whatever it may be  which appears to thee in thy sleep  is not so foolish as to suppose  when it sees me  that it is thou  judging so because the garments are thine. That however which we must find out now is this  namely if it will hold me in no account  and not think fit to appear to me  whether I have my own garments or whether I have thine  but continue still to haunt thee; for if it shall indeed haunt thee perpetually  I shall myself also be disposed to say that it is of the Deity.

Thus it seemed to Artabanos that the dream threatened him  and at the same time was just about to burn out his eyes with hot irons; and with a loud cry he started up from his bed  and sitting down beside Xerxes he related to him throughout the vision of the dream  and then said to him as follows:I  O king  as one who has seen before now many great things brought to their fall by things less  urged thee not to yield in all things to the inclination of thy youth  since I knew that it was evil to have desire after many things; remembering on the one hand the march of Cyrus against the Massagetai  what fortune it had  and also that of Cambyses against the Ethiopians; and being myself one who took part with Dareios in the campaign against the Scythians. Knowing these things I had the opinion that thou wert to be envied of all men  so long as thou shouldest keep still. Since however there comes a divine impulse  and  as it seems  a destruction sent by heaven is taking hold of the Hellenes  I for my part am both changed in myself and also I reverse my opinions; and do thou signify to the Persians the message which is sent to thee from God  bidding them follow the commands which were given by thee at first with regard to the preparations to be made; and endeavour that on thy side nothing may be wanting  since God delivers the matter into thy hands. These things having been said  both were excited to confidence by the vision  and so soon as it became day  Xerxes communicated the matter to the Persians  and Artabanos  who before was the only man who came forward to dissuade him  now came forward to urge on the design.,mashup

Xerxes being thus desirous to make the expedition  there came to him after this a third vision in his sleep  which the Magians  when they heard it  explained to have reference to the dominion of the whole Earth and to mean that all men should be subject to him; and the vision was this:— Xerxes thought that he had been crowned with a wreath of an olive-branch and that the shoots growing from the olive- tree covered the whole Earth; and after that  the wreath  placed as it was about his head  disappeared. When the Magians had thus interpreted the vision  forthwith every man of the Persians who had been assembled together departed to his own province and was zealous by all means to perform the commands  desiring each one to receive for himself the gifts which had been proposed: and thus Xerxes was gathering his army together  searching every region of the continent.,mashup

For of all the armies of which we have knowledge this proved to be by far the greatest; so that neither that led by Dareios against the Scythians appears anything as compared with it  nor the Scythian host  when the Scythians pursuing the Kimmerians made invasion of the Median land and subdued and occupied nearly all the upper parts of Asia  for which invasion afterwards Dareios attempted to take vengeance  nor that led by the sons of Atreus to Ilion  to judge by that which is reported of their expedition  nor that of the Mysians and Teucrians  before the Trojan war  who passed over into Europe by the Bosphorus and not only subdued all the Thracians  but came down also as far as the Ionian Sea and marched southwards to the river Peneios.,mashup

These are the cities which occupy Athos: and they dug as follows  the country being divided among the Barbarians by nations for the work:— at the city of Sane they drew a straight line across the isthmus  and when the channel became deep  those who stood lowest dug  while others delivered the earth as it was dug out to other men who stood above  as upon steps  and they again to others when it was received  until they came to those that were highest; and these bore it away and cast it forth. Now the others except the Phenicians had double toil by the breaking down of the steep edges of their excavation; for since they endeavoured to make the opening at the top and that at the bottom both of the same measure  some such thing was likely to result  as they worked: but the Phenicians  who are apt to show ability in their works generally  did so in this work also; for when they had had assigned to them by lot so much as fell to their share  they proceeded to dig  making the opening of the excavation at the top twice as wide as the channel itself was to be; and as the work went forward  they kept contracting the width; so that  when they came to the bottom  their work was made of equal width with that of the others. Now there is a meadow there  in which there was made for them a market and a place for buying and selling; and great quantities of corn came for them regularly from Asia  ready ground.,mashup

These things were being done by Xerxes thus; and meanwhile he caused ropes also to be prepared for the bridges  made of papyrus and of white flax  appointing this to the Phenicians and Egyptians; and also he was making preparations to store provisions for his army on the way  that neither the army itself nor the baggage animals might suffer from scarcity  as they made their march against Hellas. Accordingly  when he had learnt by inquiry of the various places  he bade them make stores where it was most convenient  carrying supplies to different parts by merchant ships and ferry-boats from all the countries of Asia.

During the time that these were working at the task which had been proposed to them  the whole land-army had been assembled together and was marching with Xerxes to Sardis  setting forth from Critalla in Cappadokia; for there it had been ordered that the whole army should assemble  which was to go with Xerxes himself by the land: but which of the governors of provinces brought the best equipped force and received from the king the gifts proposed  I am not able to say  for I do not know that they even came to a competition in this matter. Then after they had crossed the river Halys and had entered Phrygia  marching through this land they came to Kelainai  where the springs of the river Maiander come up  and also those of another river not less than the Maiander  whose name is Catarractes; this rises in the market-place itself of Kelainai and runs into the Maiander: and here also is hanging up in the city the skin of Marsyas the Silenos  which is said by the Phrygians to have been flayed off and hung up by Apollo.,mashup

In this city Pythios the son of Atys  a Lydian  was waiting for the king and entertained his whole army  as well as Xerxes himself  with the most magnificent hospitality: moreover he professed himself ready to supply money for the war. So when Pythios offered money  Xerxes asked those of the Persians who were present  who Pythios was and how much money he possessed  that he made this offer. They said:O king  this is he who presented thy father Dareios with the golden plane-tree and the golden vine; and even now he is in wealth the first of all men of whom we know  excepting thee only.,mashup

Thus he said; and Xerxes was pleased by the things which he had spoken  and replied:Lydian host  ever since I went forth from the Persian land I have encountered no man up to this time who was desirous to entertain my army  or who came into my presence and made offer of his own free will to contribute money to me for the war  except only thee: and thou not only didst entertain my army magnificently  but also now dost make offer of great sums of money. To thee therefore in return I give these rewards — I make thee my guest-friend  and I will complete for thee the four hundred myriads of staters by giving from myself the seven thousand  in order that thy four hundred myriads may not fall short by seven thousand  but thou mayest have a full sum in thy reckoning  completed thus by me.

Having thus said and having accomplished his promise  he continued his march onwards; and passing by a city of the Phrygians called Anaua and a lake whence salt is obtained  he came to Colossai  a great city of Phrygia  where the river Lycos falls into an opening of the earth and disappears from view  and then after an interval of about five furlongs it comes up to view again  and this river also flows into the Maiander. Setting forth from Colossai towards the boundaries of the Phrygians and Lydians  the army arrived at the city of Kydrara  where a pillar is fixed  set up by Croesus  which declares by an inscription that the boundaries are there.,mashup

From Phrygia then he entered Lydia; and here the road parts into two  and that which goes to the left leads towards Caria  while that which goes to the right leads to Sardis; and travelling by this latter road one must needs cross the river Maiander and pass by the city of Callatebos  where men live whose trade it is to make honey of the tamarisk-tree and of wheat-flour. By this road went Xerxes and found a plane-tree  to which for its beauty he gave an adornment of gold  and appointed that some one should have charge of it always in undying succession; and on the next day he came to the city of the Lydians.,mashup

Having come to Sardis he proceeded first to send heralds to Hellas  to ask for earth and water  and also to give notice beforehand to prepare meals for the king; except that he sent neither to Athens nor Lacedemon to ask for earth  but to all the other States: and the reason why he sent the second time to ask for earth and water was this — as many as had not given at the former time to Dareios when he sent  these he thought would certainly give now by reason of their fear: this matter it was about which he desired to have certain knowledge  and he sent accordingly.,mashup

After this he made his preparations intending to march to Abydos: and meanwhile they were bridging over the Hellespont from Asia to Europe. Now there is in the Chersonese of the Hellespont between the city of Sestos and Madytos  a broad foreland running down into the sea right opposite Abydos; this is the place where no long time afterwards the Athenians under the command of Xanthippos the son of Ariphron  having taken Artaÿctes a Persian  who was the governor of Sestos  nailed him alive to a board with hands and feet extended (he was the man who was wont to take women with him to the temple of Protesilaos at Elaius and to do things there which are not lawful ).,mashup

Then when Xerxes heard it he was exceedingly enraged  and bade them scourge the Hellespont with three hundred strokes of the lash and let down into the sea a pair of fetters. Nay  I have heard further that he sent branders also with them to brand the Hellespont. However this may be  he enjoined them  as they were beating  to say Barbarian and presumptuous words as follows:Thou bitter water  thy master lays upon thee this penalty  because thou didst wrong him not having suffered any wrong from him: and Xerxes the king will pass over thee whether thou be willing or no; but with right  as it seems  no man doeth sacrifice to thee  seeing that thou art a treacherous and briny stream.

They placed them together thus  and let down very large anchors  those on the one side towards the Pontus because of the winds which blow from within outwards  and on the other side  towards the West and the Egean  because of the South-East and South Winds. They left also an opening for a passage through  so that any who wished might be able to sail into the Pontus with small vessels  and also from the Pontus outwards. Having thus done  they proceeded to stretch tight the ropes  straining them with wooden windlasses  not now appointing the two kinds of rope to be used apart from one another  but assigning to each bridge two ropes of white flax and four of the papyrus ropes. The thickness and beauty of make was the same for both  but the flaxen ropes were heavier in proportion  and of this rope a cubit weighed one talent. When the passage was bridged over  they sawed up logs of wood  and making them equal in length to the breadth of the bridge they laid them above the stretched ropes  and having set them thus in order they again fastened them above. When this was done  they carried on brushwood  and having set the brushwood also in place  they carried on to it earth; and when they had stamped down the earth firmly  they built a barrier along on each side  so that the baggage- animals and horses might not be frightened by looking out over the sea.,mashup

When Xerxes saw and perceived this  it became a matter of concern to him; and he asked the Magians what the appearance meant to portend. These declared that the god was foreshowing to the Hellenes a leaving of their cities  saying that the Sun was the foreshower of events for the Hellenes  but the Moon for the Persians.

Then as he was leading forth his army on its march  Pythios the Lydian  being alarmed by the appearance in the heavens and elated by the gifts which he had received  came to Xerxes  and said as follows:Master  I would desire to receive from thee a certain thing at my request  which  as it chances  is for thee an easy thing to grant  but a great thing for me  if I obtain it. Then Xerxes  thinking that his request would be for anything rather than that which he actually asked  said that he would grant it  and bade him speak and say what he desired. He then  when he heard this  was encouraged  and spoke these words:Master  I have  as it chances  five sons  and it is their fortune to be all going together with thee on the march against Hellas.

Ὡς δὲ ταῦτα ὑπεκρίνατο  αὐτίκα ἐκέλευε τοῖσι προσετέτακτο ταῦτα πρήσσειν τῶν Πυθίου παίδων ἐξευρόντας τὸν πρεσβύτατον μέσον διαταμεῖν  διαταμόντας δὲ τὰ ἡμίτομα διαθεῖναι τὸ μὲν ἐπὶ δεξιὰ τῆς ὁδοῦ  τὸ δ᾽ ἐπ᾽ ἀριστερά  καὶ ταύτῃ διεξιέναι τὸν στρατόν. Ποιησάντων δὲ τούτων τοῦτο  μετὰ ταῦτα διεξήιε ὁ στρατός. Then Xerxes was exceedingly angry and made answer with these words:Thou wretched man  dost thou dare  when I am going on a march myself against Hellas  and am taking my sons and my brothers and my relations and friends  dost thou dare to make any mention of a son of thine  seeing that thou art my slave  who ought to have been accompanying me thyself with thy whole household and thy wife as well? Now therefore be assured of this  that the passionate spirit of man dwells within the ears; and when it has heard good things  it fills the body with delight  but when it has heard the opposite things to this  it swells up with anger. As then thou canst not boast of having surpassed the king in conferring benefits formerly  when thou didst to us good deeds and madest offer to do more of the same kind  so now that thou hast turned to shamelessness  thou shalt receive not thy desert but less than thou deservest: for thy gifts of hospitality shall rescue from death thyself and the four others of thy sons  but thou shalt pay the penalty with the life of the one to whom thou dost cling most. Having answered thus  he forthwith commanded those to whom it was appointed to do these things  to find out the eldest of the sons of Pythios and to cut him in two in the middle; and having cut him in two  to dispose the halves  one on the right hand of the road and the other on the left  and that the army should pass between them by this way.,mashup

When these had so done  the army proceeded to pass between; and first the baggage-bearers led the way together with their horses  and after these the host composed of all kinds of nations mingled together without distinction: and when more than the half had gone by  an interval was left and these were separated from the king. For before him went first a thousand horsemen  chosen out of all the Persians; and after them a thousand spearmen chosen also from all the Persians  having the points of their spears turned down to the ground; and then ten sacred horses  calledNesaian  with the fairest possible trappings. Now the horses are called Nesaian for this reason:— there is a wide plain in the land of Media which is called the Nesaian plain  and this plain produces the great horses of which I speak. Behind these ten horses the sacred chariot of Zeus was appointed to go  which was drawn by eight white horses; and behind the horses again followed on foot a charioteer holding the reins  for no human creature mounts upon the seat of that chariot. Then behind this came Xerxes himself in a chariot drawn by Nesaian horses  and by the side of him rode a charioteer  whose name was Patiramphes  son of Otanes a Persian.,mashup

Thus did Xerxes march forth out of Sardis; and he used to change  whenever he was so disposed  from the chariot to a carriage. And behind him went spearmen  the best and most noble of the Persians  a thousand in number  holding their spear-points in the customary way; and after them another thousand horsemen chosen out from the Persians; and after the horsemen ten thousand men chosen out from the remainder of the Persians. This body went on foot; and of these a thousand had upon their spears pomegranates of gold instead of the spikes at the butt-end  and these enclosed the others round  while the remaining nine thousand were within these and had silver pomegranates. And those also had golden pomegranates who had their spear-points turned towards the earth  while those who followed next after Xerxes had golden apples. Then to follow the ten thousand there was appointed a body of ten thousand Persian cavalry; and after the cavalry there was an interval of as much as two furlongs. Then the rest of the host came marching without distinction.,mashup

From this it went through the plain of Thebe  passing by the cities of Adramytteion and Antandros of the Pelasgians; and taking mount Ida on the left hand  it came on to the land of Ilion.

Then at break of day he set forth from thence  keeping on his left hand the cities of Rhoition and Ophryneion and Dardanos  which last borders upon Abydos  and having on the right hand the Gergith Teucrians.,mashup

There he took his seat  and looking down upon the shore he gazed both upon the land-army and the ships; and gazing upon them he had a longing to see a contest take place between the ships; and when it had taken place and the Phenicians of Sidon were victorious  he was delighted both with the contest and with the whole armament.,mashup

Artabanos his uncle therefore perceiving him — the same who at first boldly declared his opinion advising Xerxes not to march against Hellas — this man  I say  having observed that Xerxes wept  asked as follows:O king  how far different from one another are the things which thou hast done now and a short while before now! for having pronounced thyself a happy man  thou art now shedding tears. He said:Yea  for after I had reckoned up  it came into my mind to feel pity at the thought how brief was the whole life of man  seeing that of these multitudes not one will be alive when a hundred years have gone by. He then made answer and said:To another evil more pitiful than this we are made subject in the course of our life; for in the period of life  short as it is  no man  either of these here or of others  is made by nature so happy  that there will not come to him many times  and not once only  the desire to be dead rather than to live; for misfortunes falling upon us and diseases disturbing our happiness make the time of life  though short indeed  seem long: thus  since life is full of trouble  death has become the most acceptable refuge for man; and God  having given him to taste of the sweetness of life  is discovered in this matter to be full of jealousy.,mashup

Then he made answer and said:O king  neither with this army would any one who has understanding find fault  nor with the number of the ships; and indeed if thou shalt assemble more  the two things of which I speak will be made thereby yet more hostile: and these two things are— the land and the sea. For neither in the sea is there  as I suppose  a harbour anywhere large enough to receive this fleet of thine  if a storm should arise  and to ensure the safety of the ships till it be over; and yet not one alone ought this harbour to be  but there should be such harbours along the whole coast of the continent by which thou sailest; and if there are not harbours to receive thy ships  know that accidents will rule men and not men the accidents. Now having told thee of one of the two things  I am about to tell thee of the other. The land  I say  becomes hostile to thee in this way:— if nothing shall come to oppose thee  the land is hostile to thee by so much the more in proportion as thou shalt advance more  ever stealing on further and further  for there is no satiety of good fortune felt by men: and this I say  that with no one to stand against thee the country traversed  growing more and more as time goes on  will produce for thee famine. Man  however  will be in the best condition  if when he is taking counsel he feels fear  reckoning to suffer everything that can possibly come  but in doing the deed he is bold.,mashup

Xerxes made answer in these words:Artabanos  reasonably dost thou set forth these matters; but do not thou fear everything nor reckon equally for everything: for if thou shouldest set thyself with regard to all matters which come on at any time  to reckon for everything equally  thou wouldest never perform any deed. It is better to have good courage about everything and to suffer half the evils which threaten  than to have fear beforehand about everything and not to suffer any evil at all: and if  while contending against everything which is said  thou omit to declare the course which is safe  thou dost incur in these matters the reproach of failure equally with him who says the opposite to this. This then  I say  is evenly balanced: but how should one who is but man know the course which is safe? I think  in no way. To those then who choose to act  for the most part gain is wont to come; but to those who reckon for everything and shrink back  it is not much wont to come. Thou seest the power of the Persians  to what great might it has advanced: if then those who came to be kings before me had had opinions like to thine  or  though not having such opinions  had had such counsellors as thou  thou wouldest never have seen it brought forward to this point. As it is however  by running risks they conducted it on to this: for great power is in general gained by running great risks. We therefore  following their example  are making our march now during the fairest season of the year; and after we have subdued all Europe we shall return back home  neither having met with famine anywhere nor having suffered any other thing which is unpleasant. For first we march bearing with us ourselves great store of food  and secondly we shall possess the corn-crops of all the peoples to whose land and nation we come; and we are making a march now against men who plough the soil  and not against nomad tribes.,mashup

After this Artabanos said:O king  since thou dost urge us not to have fear of anything  do thou I pray thee accept a counsel from me; for when speaking of many things it is necessary to extend speech to a greater length. Cyrus the son of Cambyses subdued all Ionia except the Athenians  so that it was tributary to the Persians. These men therefore I counsel thee by no means to lead against their parent stock  seeing that even without these we are able to get the advantage over our enemies. For supposing that they go with us  either they must prove themselves doers of great wrong  if they join in reducing their mother city to slavery  or doers of great right  if they join in freeing her: now if they show themselves doers of great wrong  they bring us no very large gain in addition; but if they show themselves doers of great right  they are able then to cause much damage to thy army. Therefore lay to heart also the ancient saying  how well it has been said that at the first beginning of things the end does not completely appear.,mashup

Besides this  seeing that they have left children and wives and wealth in our land  we must not even imagine that they will make any rebellion. Fear not then this thing either  but have a good heart and keep safe my house and my government; for to thee of all men I entrust my sceptre of rule.,mashup

Having thus spoken and having sent Artabanos back to Susa  next Xerxes summoned to his presence the men of most repute among the Persians  and when they were come before him  he spoke to them as follows:Persians  I assembled you together desiring this of you  that ye should show yourselves good men and should not disgrace the deeds done in former times by the Persians  which are great and glorious; but let us each one of us by himself  and all together also  be zealous in our enterprise; for this which we labour for is a common good for all. And I exhort you that ye preserve in the war without relaxing your efforts  because  as I am informed  we are marching against good men  and if we shall overcome them  there will not be any other army of men which will ever stand against us. Now therefore let us begin the crossing  after having made prayer to those gods who have the Persians for their allotted charge.,mashup

During this day then they were making preparation to cross over; and on the next day they waited for the Sun  desiring to see him rise  and in the meantime they offered all kinds of incense upon the bridges and strewed the way with branches of myrtle. Then  as the Sun was rising  Xerxes made libation from a golden cup into the sea  and prayed to the Sun  that no accident might befall him such as should cause him to cease from subduing Europe  until he had come to its furthest limits. After having thus prayed he threw the cup into the Hellespont and with it a golden mixing-bowl and a Persian sword  which they call  akinakes: but whether he cast them into the sea as an offering dedicated to the Sun  or whether he had repented of his scourging of the Hellespont and desired to present a gift to the sea as amends for this  I cannot for certain say.,mashup

When Xerxes had done this  they proceeded to cross over  the whole army both the footmen and the horsemen going by one bridge  namely that which was on the side of the Pontus  while the baggage-animals and the attendants went over the other  which was towards the Egean. First the ten thousand Persians led the way  all with wreaths  and after them came the mixed body of the army made up of all kinds of nations: these on that day; and on the next day  first the horsemen and those who had their spear- points turned downwards  these also wearing wreaths; and after them the sacred horses and the sacred chariot  and then Xerxes himself and the spear-bearers and the thousand horsemen; and after them the rest of the army. In the meantime the ships also put out from shore and went over to the opposite side. I have heard however another account which says that the king crossed over the very last of all.,mashup

When Xerxes had crossed over into Europe  he gazed upon the army crossing under the lash; and his army crossed over in seven days and seven nights  going on continuously without any pause. Then  it is said  after Xerxes had now crossed over the Hellespont  a man of that coast exclaimed:Why  O Zeus  in the likeness of a Persian man and taking for thyself the name of Xerxes instead of Zeus  art thou proposing to lay waste Hellas  taking with thee all the nations of men? for it was possible for thee to do so even without the help of these.,mashup

When all had crossed over  after they had set forth on their way a great portent appeared to them  of which Xerxes made no account  although it was easy to conjecture its meaning — a mare gave birth to a hare. Now the meaning of this was easy to conjecture in this way  namely that Xerxes was about to march an army against Hellas very proudly and magnificently  but would come back again to the place whence he came  running for his life. There happened also a portent of another kind while he was still at Sardis — a mule brought forth young and gave birth to a mule which had organs of generation of two kinds  both those of the male and those of the female  and those of the male were above. Xerxes however made no account of either of these portents  but proceeded on his way  and with him the land-army.,mashup

The fleet meanwhile was sailing out of the Hellespont and coasting along  going in the opposite direction to the land-army; for the fleet was sailing towards the West  making for the promontory of Sarpedon  to which it had been ordered beforehand to go  and there wait for the army; but the land-army meanwhile was making its march towards the East and the sunrising  through the Chersonese  keeping on its right the tomb of Helle the daughter of Athamas  and on its left the city of Cardia  and marching through the midst of a town the name of which is Agora. Thence bending round the gulf called Melas and having crossed over the river Melas  the stream of which did not suffice at this time for the army but failed — having crossed  I say  this river  from which the gulf also has its name  it went on Westwards  passing by Ainos a city of the Aiolians  and by the lake Stentoris  until at last it came to Doriscos.,mashup

Now Doriscos is a sea-beach and plain of great extent in Thrace  and through it flows the great river Hebros: here a royal fortress had been built  the same which is now called Doriscos  and a garrison of Persians had been established in it by Dareios  ever since the time when he went on his march against the Scythians. It seemed then to Xerxes that the place was convenient to order his army and to number it throughout  and so he proceeded to do. The commanders of the ships at the bidding of Xerxes had brought all their ships  when they arrived at Doriscos  up to the sea-beach which adjoins Doriscos  on which there is situated both Sale a city of the Samothrakians  and also Zone  and of which the extreme point is the promontory of Serreion  which is well known; and the region belonged in ancient time to the Kikonians. To this beach then they had brought in their ships  and having drawn them up on land they were letting them get dry: and during this time he proceeded to number the army at Doriscos.,mashup

Now of the number which each separate nation supplied I am not able to give certain information  for this is not reported by any persons; but of the whole land-army taken together the number proved to be one hundred and seventy myriads: and they numbered them throughout in the following manner:— they gathered together in one place a body of ten thousand men  and packing them together as closely as they could  they drew a circle round outside: and thus having drawn a circle round and having let the ten thousand men go from it  they built a wall of rough stones round the circumference of the circle  rising to the height of a man's navel. Having made this  they caused others to go into the space which had been built round  until they had in this manner numbered them all throughout: and after they had numbered them  they ordered them separately by nations.,mashup

Now these were called by the Hellenes in ancient time Kephenes; by themselves however and by their neighbours they were called Artaians: but when Perseus  the son of Danae and Zeus  came to Kepheus the son of Belos and took to wife his daughter Andromeda  there was born to them a son to whom he gave the name Perses  and this son he left behind there  for it chanced that Kepheus had no male offspring: after him therefore this race was named.,mashup

These Ethiopians from Asia were armed for the most part like the Indians  but they had upon their heads the skin of a horse's forehead flayed off with the ears and the mane  and the mane served instead of a crest  while they had the ears of the horse set up straight and stiff: and instead of shields they used to make defences to hold before themselves of the skins of cranes.,mashup

The Bactrians were equipped in the same way as those who served on foot  and the Caspians likewise. The Libyans too were equipped like those who served on foot  and these also all drove chariots. So too the Caspians and Paricanians were equipped like those who served on foot  and they all rode on camels  which in swiftness were not inferior to horses.,mashup

The commanders of the cavalry were Harmamithras and Tithaios sons of Datis  but the third  Pharnuches  who was in command of the horse with them  had been left behind at Sardis sick: for as they were setting forth from Sardis  an accident befell him of an unwished-for kind — as he was riding  a dog ran up under his horse's feet  and the horse not having seen it beforehand was frightened  and rearing up he threw Pharnuches off his back  who falling vomited blood  and his sickness turned to a consumption. To the horse however they forthwith at the first did as he commanded  that is to say  the servants led him away to the place where he had thrown his master and cut off his legs at the knees. Thus was Pharnuches removed from his command.,mashup

Of the rest of the officers I make no mention by the way (since I am not bound to do so )  but only of Artemisia  at whom I marvel most that she joined the expedition against Hellas  being a woman; for after her husband died  she holding the power herself  although she had a son who was a young man  went on the expedition impelled by high spirit and manly courage  no necessity being laid upon her. Now her name  as I said  was Artemisia and she was the daughter of Lygdamis  and by descent she was of Halicarnassos on the side of her father  but of Crete by her mother. She was ruler of the men of Halicarnassos and Cos and Nisyros and Calydna  furnishing five ships; and she furnished ships which were of all the fleet reputed the best after those of the Sidonians  and of all his allies she set forth the best counsels to the king. Of the States of which I said that she was leader I declare the people to be all of Dorian race  those of Halicarnassos being Troizenians  and the rest Epidaurians.

When he had done this  the ships were drawn down into the sea  and Xerxes changing from his chariot to a ship of Sidon sat down under a golden canopy and sailed along by the prows of the ships  asking of all just as he had done with the land-army  and having the answers written down. And the captains had taken their ships out to a distance of about four hundred feet from the beach and were staying them there  all having turned the prows of the ships towards the shore in an even line and having armed all the fighting-men as for war; and he inspected them sailing within  between the prows of the ships and the beach.,mashup

Thou art not only a Hellene  but also  as I am informed both by thee and by the other Hellenes who come to speech with me  of a city which is neither the least nor the feeblest of Hellas.

I desire however to be informed also of thy opinion  what thou sayest about these matters.

Now I commend all the Hellenes who are settled in those Dorian lands  but this which I am about to say has regard not to tall  but to the Lacedemonians alone: of these I say  first that it is not possible that they will ever accept thy terms  which carry with them servitude for Hellas; and next I say that they will stand against thee in fight  even if all the other Hellenes shall be of thy party: and as for numbers  ask now how many they are  that they are able to do this; for whether it chances that a thousand of them have come out into the field  these will fight with thee  or if there be less than this  or again if there be more.,mashup

Xerxes hearing this laughed  and said:Demaratos  what a speech is this which thou hast uttered  saying that a thousand men will fight with this vast army! Come tell me this:— thou sayest that thou wert thyself king of these men; wilt thou therefore consent forthwith to fight with ten men? and yet if your State is such throughout as thou dost describe it  thou their king ought by your laws to stand in array against double as many as another man; that is to say  if each of them is a match for ten men of my army  I expect of thee that thou shouldest be a match for twenty. Thus would be confirmed the report which is made by thee: but if ye  who boast thus greatly are such men and in size so great only as the Hellenes who come commonly to speech with me  thyself included  then beware lest this which has been spoken prove but an empty vaunt. For come  let me examine it by all that is probable: how could a thousand or ten thousand or even fifty thousand  at least if they were all equally free and were not ruled by one man  stand against so great an army? since  as thou knowest  we shall be more than a thousand coming about each one of them  supposing them to be in number five thousand. If indeed they were ruled by one man after our fashion  they might perhaps from fear of him become braver than it was their nature to be  or they might go compelled by the lash to fight with greater numbers  being themselves fewer in number; but if left at liberty  they would do neither of these things: and I for my part suppose that  even if equally matched in numbers  the Hellenes would hardly dare to fight with the Persians taken alone. With us however this of which thou speakest is found in single men  not indeed often  but rarely; for there are Persians of my spearmen who will consent to fight with three men of the Hellenes at once: but thou hast had no experience of these things and therefore thou speakest very much at random.,mashup

To this Demaratos replied:O king  from the first I was sure that if I uttered the truth I should not speak that which was pleasing to thee; since however thou didst compel me to speak the very truth  I told thee of the matters which concern the Spartans. And yet how I am at this present time attached to them by affection thou knowest better than any; seeing that first they took away from me the rank and privileges which came to me from my fathers  and then also they have caused me to be without native land and an exile; but thy father took me up and gave me livelihood and a house to dwell in. Surely it is not to be supposed likely that the prudent man will thrust aside friendliness which is offered to him  but rather that he will accept it with full contentment. And I do not profess that I am able to fight either with ten men or with two  nay  if I had my will  I would not even fight with one; but if there were necessity or if the cause which urged me to the combat were a great one  I would fight most willingly with one of these men who says that he is a match for three of the Hellenes. So also the Lacedemonians are not inferior to any men when fighting one by one  and they are the best of all men when fighting in a body: for though free  yet they are not free in all things  for over them is set Law as a master  whom they fear much more even than thy people fear thee. It is certain at least that they do whatsoever that master commands; and he commands ever the same thing  that is to say  he bids them not flee out of battle from any multitude of men  but stay in their post and win the victory or lose their life. But if when I say these things I seem to thee to be speaking at random  of other things for the future I prefer to be silent; and at this time I spake only because I was compelled. May it come to pass however according to thy mind  O king.,mashup

He thus made answer  and Xerxes turned the matter to laughter and felt no anger  but dismissed him with kindness.

And Mascames  whom he left behind here  proved to be a man of such qualities that to him alone Xerxes used to send gifts  considering him the best of all the men whom either he himself or Dareios had appointed to be governors — he used to send him gifts  I say  every year  and so also did Artaxerxes the son of Xerxes to the descendants of Mascames. For even before this march governors had been appointed in Thrace and everywhere about the Hellespont; and these all  both those in Thrace and in the Hellespont  were conquered by the Hellenes after this expedition  except only the one who was at Doriscos; but Mascames at Doriscos none were ever able to conquer  though many tried. For this reason the gifts are sent continually for him from the king who reigns over the Persians.,mashup

Of those however who were conquered by the Hellenes Xerxes did not consider any to be a good man except only Boges  who was at Eion: him he never ceased commending  and he honoured very highly his children who survived him in the land of Persia. For in truth Boges proved himself worthy of great commendation  seeing that when he was besieged by the Athenians under Kimon the son of Miltiades  though he might have gone forth under a truce and so returned home to Asia  he preferred not to do this  for fear that the king should that it was by cowardice that he survived; and he continued to hold out till the last. Then when there was no longer any supply of provisions within the wall  he heaped together a great pyre  and he cut the throats of his children  his wife  his concubines and his servants  and threw them into the fire; and after this he scattered all the gold and silver in the city from the wall into the river Strymon  and having so done he threw himself into the fire. Thus he is justly commended even to this present time by the Persians.,mashup

Xerxes from Doriscos was proceeding onwards to invade Hellas; and as he went he compelled those who successively came in his way  to join his march: for the whole country as far as Thessaly had been reduced to subjection  as has been set forth by me before  and was tributary under the king  having been subdued by Megabazos and afterwards by Mardonios. And he passed in his march from Doriscos first by the Samothrakian strongholds  of which that which is situated furthest towards the West is a city called Mesambria. Next to this follows Stryme  a city of the Thasians  and midway between them flows the river Lisos  which at this time did not suffice when supplying its water to the army of Xerxes  but the stream failed. This country was in old time called Gallaike  but now Briantike; however by strict justice this also belongs to the Kikonians.,mashup

Then after passing these places he went by the cities of the mainland  near one of which there is  as it chances  a lake of somewhere about thirty furlongs in circumference  abounding in fish and very brackish; this the baggage-animals alone dried up  being watered at it: and the name of this city is Pistyros.,mashup

As the army proceeded on its march from the Strymon  it found after this a sea-beach stretching towards the setting of the sun  and passed by the Hellenic city  Argilos  which was there placed. This region and that which lies above it is called Bisaltia. Thence  keeping on the left hand the gulf which lies of Posideion  he went through the plain which is called the plain of Syleus  passing by Stageiros a Hellenic city  and so came to Acanthos  taking with him as he went each one of these tribes and also of those who dwell about Mount Pangaion  just as he did those whom I enumerated before  having the men who dwelt along the sea coast to serve in the ships and those who dwelt inland to accompany him on foot. This road by which Xerxes the king marched his army  the Thracians do not disturb nor sow crops over  but pay very great reverence to it down to my own time.,mashup

And while Xerxes was in Acanthos  it happened that he who had been set over the making of the channel  Artachaies by name  died of sickness  a man who was highly esteemed by Xerxes and belonged to the Achaimenid family; also he was in stature the tallest of all the Persians  falling short by only four fingers of being five royal cubits in height  and he had a voice the loudest of all men; so that Xerxes was greatly grieved at the loss of him  and carried him forth and buried him with great honour  and the whole army joined in throwing up a mound for him.

King Xerxes  I say  was greatly grieved at the loss of Artachaies: and meanwhile the Hellenes who were entertaining his army and providing Xerxes with dinners had been brought to utter ruin  so that they were being driven from house and home; seeing that when the Thasians  for example  entertained the army of Xerxes and provided him with a dinner on behalf of their towns upon the mainland  Antipater the son of Orgeus  who had been appointed for this purpose  a man of repute among the citizens equal to the best  reported that four hundred talents of silver had been spent upon the dinner.,mashup

Just so or nearly so in the other cities also those who were set over the business reported the reckoning to be: for the dinner was given as follows  having been ordered a long time beforehand  and being counted by them a matter of great importance:— In the first place  so soon as they heard of it from the heralds who carried round the proclamation  the citizens in the various cities distributed corn among their several households  and all continued to make wheat and barley meal for many months; then they fed cattle  finding out and obtaining the finest animals for a high price; and they kept birds both of the land and of the water  in cages or in pools  all for the entertainment of the army. Then again they had drinking-cups and mixing-bowls made of gold and of silver  and all the other things which are placed upon the table: these were made for the king himself and for those who ate at his table; but for the rest of the army only the things appointed for food were provided. Then whenever the army came to any place  there was a tent pitched ready wherein Xerxes himself made his stay  while the rest of the army remained out in the open air; and when it came to be time for dinner  then the entertainers had labour; but the others  after they had been satiated with food and had spent the night there  on the next day tore up the tent and taking with them all the movable furniture proceeded on their march  leaving nothing  but carrying all away with them.,mashup

Then sailing from Aineia  with which name I brought to an end the list of the cities  at once the fleet came into the Thermaic gulf and to the region of Mygdonia  and so it arrived at the aforesaid Therma and at the cities of Sindos and Chalestra upon the river Axios.

Then Xerxes seeing from Therma the mountains of Thessaly  Olympos and Ossa  that they were of very great height  and being informed that in the midst between them there was a narrow channel  through which flows the Peneios  and hearing also that by this way there was a good road leading to Thessaly  formed a desire to sail thither and look at the outlet of the Peneios  because he was meaning to march by the upper road  through the land of the Macedonians who dwell inland  until he came to the Perraibians  passing by the city of Gonnos; for by this way he was informed that it was safest to go. And having formed this desire  so also he proceeded to do; that is  he embarked in a Sidonian ship  the same in which he used always to embark when he wished to do anything of this kind  and he displayed a signal for the others to put out to sea also  leaving there the land-army. Then when Xerxes had looked at the outlet of the Peneios  he was possessed by great wonder  and summoning his guides he asked them whether it was possible to turn the river aside and bring it out to the sea by another way.,mashup

Now it is said that Thessaly was in old time a lake  being enclosed on all sides by very lofty mountains: for the parts of it which lie towards the East are shut in by the ranges of Pelion and Ossa  which join one another in their lower slopes  the parts towards the North Wind by Olympos  those towards the West by Pindos and those towards the mid-day and the South Wind by Othrys; and the region in the midst  between these mountains which have been named  is Thessaly  forming as it were a hollow. Whereas then many rivers flow into it and among them these five of most note  namely Peneios  Apidanos  Onochonos  Enipeus and Pamisos  these  which collect their waters from the mountains that enclose Thessaly round  and flow into this plain  with names separate each one  having their outflow into the sea by one channel and that a narrow one  first mingling their waters all together in one and the same stream; and so soon as they are mingled together  from that point onwards the Peneios prevails with its name over the rest and causes the others to lose their separate names. And it is said that in ancient time  there not being yet this channel and outflow between the mountains  these rivers  and besides these rivers the lake Boibeis also  had no names as they have now  but by their waters they made Thessaly to be all sea. The Thessalians themselves say that Poseidon made the channel through which the Peneios flows; and reasonably they report it thus  because whosoever believes that it is Poseidon who shakes the Earth and that the partings asunder produced by earthquake are the work of this god  would say  if he saw this  that it was made by Poseidon; for the parting asunder of the mountains is the work of an earthquake  as is evident to me.,mashup

So the guides  when Xerxes asked whether there was any other possible outlet to the sea for the Peneios  said with exact knowledge of the truth:O king  for this river there is no other outgoing which extends to the sea  but this alone; for all Thessaly is circled about with mountains as with a crown. To this Xerxes is said to have replied:The Thessalians then are prudent men. This it appears was that which they desired to guard against in good time when they changed their counsel  reflecting on this especially besides other things  namely that they had a country which  it appears  is easy to conquer and may quickly be taken: for it would have been necessary only to let the river flow over their land by making an embankment to keep it from going through the narrow channel and so diverting the course by which now it flows  in order to put all Thessaly under water except the mountains. This he said in reference to the sons of Aleuas  because they  being Thessalians  were the first of the Hellenes who gave themselves over to the king; for Xerxes thought that they offered him friendship on behalf of their whole nation. Having said thus and having looked at the place  he sailed back to Therma.,mashup

Against these the Hellenes who took up war with the Barbarian made an oath; and the oath was this — that whosoever being Hellenes had given themselves over to the Persian  not being compelled  these  if their own affairs should come to a good conclusion  they would dedicate as an offering to the god at Delphi.,mashup

Thus ran the oath which was taken by the Hellenes: Xerxes however had not sent to Athens or to Sparta heralds to demand the gift of earth  and for this reason  namely because at the former time when Dareios had sent for this very purpose  the one people threw the men who made the demand into the pit and the others into a well  and bade them take from thence earth and water and bear them to the king. For this reason Xerxes did not send men to make this demand. And what evil thing came upon the Athenians for having done this to the heralds  I am not able to say  except indeed that their land and city were laid waste; but I do not think that this happened for that cause:,mashup

This was the case with them for a long time; and as the Lacedemonians were grieved and regarded it as a great misfortune  and general assemblies were repeatedly gathered together and proclamation made  asking if any one of the Lacedemonians was willing to die for Sparta  at length Sperthias the son of Aneristos and Bulis the son of Nicolaos  Spartans of noble birth and in wealth attaining to the first rank  voluntarily submitted to pay the penalty to Xerxes for the heralds of Dareios which had perished at Sparta.

And not only the courage then shown by these men is worthy of admiration  but also the following sayings in addition: for as they were on their way to Susa they came to Hydarnes (now Hydarnes was a Persian by race and commander of those who dwelt on the sea coasts of Asia )  and he offered them hospitality and entertained them; and while they were his guests he asked them as follows:Lacedemonians  why is it that ye flee from becoming friends to the king? for ye may see that the king knows how to honour good men  when ye look at me and at my fortunes. So also ye  Lacedemonians  if ye gave yourselves to the king  since ye have the reputation with him already of being good men  would have rule each one of you over Hellenic land by the gift of the king. To this they made answer thus:Hydarnes  thy counsel with regard to us is not equally balanced  for thou givest counsel having made trial indeed of the one thing  but being without experience of the other: thou knowest well what it is to be a slave  but thou hast never yet made trial of freedom  whether it is pleasant to the taste or no; for if thou shouldest make trial of it  thou wouldest then counsel us to fight for it not with spears only but also with axes.,mashup

Thus they answered Hydarnes; and then  after they had gone up to Susa and had come into the presence of the king  first when the spearmen of the guard commanded them and endeavoured to compel them by force to do obeisance to the king by falling down before him  they said that they would not do any such deed  though they should be pushed down by them head foremost; for it was not their custom to do obeisance to a man  and it was not for this that they had come. Then when they had resisted this  next they spoke these words or words to this effect:O king of the Medes  the Lacedemonians sent us in place of the heralds who were slain in Sparta  to pay the penalty for their lives. When they said this  Xerxes moved by a spirit of magnanimity replied that he would not be like the Lacedemonians; for they had violated the rules which prevailed among all men by slaying heralds  but he would not do that himself which he blamed them for having done  nor would he free the Lacedemonians from their guilt by slaying these in return.,mashup

Thus the wrath of Talthybios ceased for the time being  even though the Spartans had done no more than this and although Sperthias and Bulis returned back to Sparta; but a long time after this it was roused again during the war between the Peloponnesians and Athenians  as the Lacedemonians report. This I perceive to have been most evidently the act of the Deity: for in that the wrath of Talthybios fell upon messengers and did not cease until it had been fully satisfied  so much was but in accordance with justice; but that it happened to come upon the sons of these men who went up to the king on account of the wrath  namely upon Nicolaos the son of Bulis and Aneristos the son of Sperthias (the same who conquered the men of Halieis  who came from Tiryns  by sailing into their harbour with a merchant ship filled with fighting men ) — by this it is evident to me that the matter came to pass by the act of the Deity caused by this wrath. For these men  sent by the Lacedemonians as envoys to Asia  having been betrayed by Sitalkes the son of Teres king of the Thracians and by Nymphodoros the son of Pythes a man of Abdera  were captured at Bisanthe on the Hellespont; and then having been carried away to Attica they were put to death by the Athenians  and with them also Aristeas the son of Adeimantos the Corinthian. These things happened many years after the expedition of the king; and I return now to the former narrative.,mashup

Now the march of the king's army was in name against Athens  but in fact it was going against all Hellas: and the Hellenes being informed of this long before were not all equally affected by it; for some of them having given earth and water to the Persian had confidence  supposing that they would suffer no hurt from the Barbarian; while others not having given were in great terror  seeing that there were not ships existing in Hellas which were capable as regards number of receiving the invader in fight  and seeing that the greater part of the States were not willing to take up the war  but adopted readily the side of the Medes.,mashup

And here I am compelled by necessity to declare an opinion which in the eyes of most men would seem to be invidious  but nevertheless I will not abstain from saying that which I see evidently to be the truth. If the Athenians had been seized with fear of the danger which threatened them and had left their land  or again  without leaving their land  had stayed and given themselves up to Xerxes  none would have made any attempt by sea to oppose the king. If then none had opposed Xerxes by sea  it would have happened on the land somewhat thus:— even if many tunics of walls had been thrown across the Isthmus by the Peloponnesians  the Lacedemonians would have been deserted by their allies  not voluntarily but of necessity  since these would have been conquered city after city by the naval force of the Barbarian  and so they would have been left alone: and having been left alone and having displayed great deeds of valour  they would have met their death nobly. Either they would have suffered this fate  or before this  seeing the other Hellenes also taking the side of the Medes  they would have made an agreement with Xerxes; and thus in either case Hellas would have come to be under the rule of the Persians: for as to the good to be got from the walls thrown across the Isthmus  I am unable to discover what it would have been  when the king had command of the sea. As it is however  if a man should say that the Athenians proved to be the saviours of Hellas  he would not fail to hit the truth; for to whichever side these turned  to that the balance was likely to incline: and these were they who  preferring that Hellas should continue to exist in freedom  roused up all of Hellas which remained  so much  that is  as had not gone over to the Medes  and (after the gods at least ) these were they who repelled the king.

For the Athenians had sent men to Delphi to inquire and were preparing to consult the Oracle; and after these had performed the usual rites in the sacred precincts  when they had entered the sanctuary and were sitting down there  the Pythian prophetess  whose name was Aristonike  uttered to them this oracle:Why do ye sit  O ye wretched? Flee thou to the uttermost limits  Leaving thy home and the heights of the wheel-round city behind thee! Lo  there remaineth now nor the head nor the body in safety — Neither the feet below nor the hands nor the middle are left thee — All are destroyed together; for fire and the passionate War-god  Urging the Syrian car to speed  doth hurl them to ruin. Not thine alone  he shall cause many more great strongholds to perish  Yes  many temples of gods to the ravening fire shall deliver — Temples which stand now surely with sweat of their terror down-streaming  Quaking with dread; and lo! from the topmost roof to the pavement Dark blood trickles  forecasting the dire unavoidable evil. Forth with you  forth from the shrine  and steep your soul in the sorrow!,mashup

Hearing this the men who had been sent by the Athenians to consult the Oracle were very greatly distressed; and as they were despairing by reason of the evil which had been prophesied to them  Timon the son of Androbulos  a man of the Delphians in reputation equal to the first  counselled them to take a suppliant's bough and to approach the second time and consult the Oracle as suppliants. The Athenians did as he advised and said:Lord  we pray thee utter to us some better oracle about our native land  having respect to these suppliant boughs which we have come to thee bearing; otherwise surely we will not depart away from the sanctuary  but will remain here where we are now  even until we bring our lives to an end. When they spoke these words  the prophetess gave them a second oracle as follows:Pallas cannot prevail to appease great Zeus in Olympos  Though she with words very many and wiles close-woven entreat him. But I will tell thee this more  and will clench it with steel adamantine: Then when all else shall be taken  whatever the boundary of Kecrops Holdeth within  and the dark ravines of divinest Kithairon  A bulwark of wood at the last Zeus grants to the Trito-born goddess Sole to remain unwasted  which thee and thy children shall profit. Stay thou not there for the horsemen to come and the footmen unnumbered; Stay thou not still for the host from the mainland to come  but retire thee  Turning thy back to the foe  for yet thou shalt face him hereafter. Salamis  thou the divine  thou shalt cause sons of women to perish  Or when the grain is scattered or when it is gathered together.,mashup

This seemed to them to be (as in truth it was ) a milder utterance than the former one; therefore they had it written down and departed with it to Athens: and when the messengers after their return made report to the people  many various opinions were expressed by persons inquiring into the meaning of the oracle  and among them these  standing most in opposition to one another:— some of the elder men said they thought that the god had prophesied to them that the Acropolis should survive; for the Acropolis of the Athenians was in old time fenced with a thorn hedge; and they conjectured accordingly that this saying about thebulwark of wood referred to the fence: others on the contrary said that the god meant by this their ships  and they advised to leave all else and get ready these. Now they who said that the ships were the bulwark of wood were shaken in their interpretation by the two last verses which the prophetess uttered:Salamis  thou the divine  thou shalt cause sons of women to perish  Or when the grain is scattered or when it is gathered together. In reference to these verses the opinions of those who said that the ships were the bulwark of wood were disturbed; for the interpreters of oracles took these to mean that it was fated for them  having got ready for a sea-fight  to suffer defeat round about Salamis.,mashup

Now there was one man of the Athenians who had lately been coming forward to take a place among the first  whose name was Themistocles  called son of Neocles. This man said that the interpreters of oracles did not make right conjecture of the whole  and he spoke as follows  saying that if these words that had been uttered referred really to the Athenians  he did not think it would have been so mildly expressed in the oracle  but rather thus Salamis  thou the merciless  instead ofSalamis  thou the divine  at least if its settlers were destined to perish round about it: but in truth the oracle had been spoken by the god with reference to the enemy  if one understood it rightly  and not to the Athenians: therefore he counselled them to get ready to fight a battle by sea  for in this was their bulwark of wood. When Themistocles declared his opinion thus  the Athenians judged that this was to be preferred by them rather than the advice of the interpreters of oracles  who bade them not make ready for a sea-fight  nor in short raise their hands at all in opposition  but leave the land of Attica and settle in some other.,mashup

Another opinion too of Themistocles before this one proved the best at the right moment  when the Athenians  having got large sums of money in the public treasury  which had come in to them from the mines which are at Laureion  were intending to share it among themselves  taking each in turn the sum of ten drachmas. Then Themistocles persuaded the Athenians to give up this plan of division and to make for themselves with this money two hundred ships for the war  meaning by that the war with the Eginetans: for this war having arisen proved in fact the salvation of Hellas at that time  by compelling the Athenians to become a naval power. And the ships  not having been used for the purpose for which they had been made  thus proved of service at need to Hellas. These ships then  I say  the Athenians had already  having built them beforehand  and it was necessary in addition to these to construct others. They resolved then  when they took counsel after the oracle was given  to receive the Barbarian invading Hellas with their ships in full force  following the commands of the god  in combination with those of the Hellenes who were willing to join them.,mashup

These oracles had been given before to the Athenians: and when those Hellenes who had the better mind about Hellas came together to one place  and considered their affairs and interchanged assurances with one another  then deliberating together they thought it well first of all things to reconcile the enmities and bring to an end the wars which they had with one another. Now there were wars engaged between others also  and especially between the Athenians and the Eginetans. After this  being informed that Xerxes was with his army at Sardis  they determined to send spies to Asia to make observation of the power of the king; and moreover they resolved to send envoys to Argos to form an alliance against the Persian  and to send others to Sicily to Gelon the son of Deinomenes and also to Corcyra  to urge them to come to the assistance of Hellas  and others again to Crete; for they made it their aim that if possible the Hellenic race might unite in one  and that they might join all together and act towards the same end  since dangers were threatening all the Hellenes equally. Now the power of Gelon was said to be great  far greater than any other Hellenic power.,mashup

When they had thus resolved  they reconciled their enmities and then sent first three men as spies to Asia. These having come to Sardis and having got knowledge about the king's army  were discovered  and after having been examined by the generals of the land-army were being led off to die. For these men  I say  death had been determined; but Xerxes  being informed of this  found fault with the decision of the generals and sent some of the spearmen of his guard  enjoining them  if they should find the spies yet alive  to bring them to his presence. So having found them yet surviving they brought them into the presence of the king; and upon that Xerxes  being informed for what purpose they had come  commanded the spearmen to lead them round and to show them the whole army both foot and horse  and when they should have had their fill of looking at these things  to let them go unhurt to whatsoever land they desired.,mashup

This opinion of his is like his manner of thinking at other times; for when Xerxes was in Abydos  he saw vessels which carried corn from the Pontus sailing out through the Hellespont on their way to Egina and the Peloponnese. Those then who sat by his side  being informed that the ships belonged to the enemy  were prepared to capture them  and were looking to the king to see when he would give the word; but Xerxes asked about them whither the men were sailing  and they replied:Master  to thy foes  conveying to them corn: he then made answer and said:Are we not also sailing to the same place as these men  furnished with corn as well as with other things necessary? How then do these wrong us  since they are conveying provisions for our use ?,mashup

The spies then  having thus looked at everything and after that having been dismissed  returned back to Europe: and meanwhile those of the Hellenes who had sworn alliance against the Persian  after the sending forth of the spies proceeded to send envoys next to Argos. Now the Argives report that the matters concerning themselves took place as follows:— They were informed  they say  at the very first of the movement which was being set on foot by the Barbarian against Hellas; and having been informed of this and perceiving that the Hellenes would endeavour to get their alliance against the Persians  they had sent messengers to inquire of the god at Delphi  and to ask how they should act in order that it might be best for themselves: because lately there had been slain of them six thousand men by the Lacedemonians and by Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides  and this in fact was the reason that they were sending to inquire: and when they inquired  the Pythian prophetess made answer to them as follows:Thou to thy neighbours a foe  by the gods immortal beloved  Keep thou thy spear within bounds  and sit well-guarded behind it: Guard well the head  and the head shall preserve the limbs and the body. Thus  they say  the Pythian prophetess had replied to them before this; and afterwards when the messengers of the Hellenes came  as I said  to Argos  they entered the Council-chamber and spoke that which had been enjoined to them; and to that which was said the Council replied that the Argives were ready to do as they were requested  on condition that they got peace made with the Lacedemonians for thirty years and that they had half the leadership of the whole confederacy: and yet by strict right (they said ) the whole leadership fell to their share  but nevertheless it was sufficient for them to have half.,mashup

Thus they report that the Council made answer  although the oracle forbade them to make the alliance with the Hellenes; and they were anxious  they say  that a truce from hostilities for thirty years should be made  although they feared the oracle  in order  as they allege  that their sons might grow to manhood in these years; whereas if a truce did not exist  they had fear that  supposing another disaster should come upon them in fighting against the Persian in addition to that which had befallen them already  they might be for all future time subject to the Lacedemonians. To that which was spoken by the Council those of the envoys who were of Sparta replied  that as to the truce they would refer the matter to their public assembly  but as to the leadership they had themselves been commissioned to make reply  and did in fact say this  namely that they had two kings  while the Argives had one; and it was not possible to remove either of the two who were of Sparta from the leadership  but there was nothing to prevent the Argive king from having an equal vote with each of their two. Then  say the Argives  they could not endure the grasping selfishness of the Spartans  but chose to be ruled by the Barbarians rather than to yield at all to the Lacedemonians; and they gave notice to the envoys to depart out of the territory of the Argives before sunset  or  if not  they would be dealt with as enemies.,mashup

The Argives themselves report so much about these matters: but there is another story reported in Hellas to the effect that Xerxes sent a herald to Argos before he set forth to make an expedition against Hellas  and this herald  they say  when he had come  spoke as follows:Men of Argos  king Xerxes says to you these things:— We hold that Perses  from whom we are descended  was the son of Perseus  the son of Danae  and was born of the daughter of Kepheus  Andromeda; and according to this it would seem that we are descended from you. It is not fitting then that we should go forth on an expedition against those from whom we trace our descent  nor that ye should set yourselves in opposition to us by rendering assistance to others; but it is fitting that ye keep still and remain by yourselves: for if things happen according to my mind  I shall not esteem any people to be of greater consequence than you. Having heard this the Argives  it is said  considered it a great matter; and therefore at first they made no offer of help nor did they ask for any share; but afterwards  when the Hellenes tried to get them on their side  then  since they knew well that the Lacedemonians would not give them a share in the command  they asked for this merely in order that they might have a pretext for remaining still.,mashup

Also some of the Hellenes report that the following event  in agreement with this account  came to pass many years after these things:— there happened  they say  to be in Susa the city of Memnon envoys of the Athenians come about some other matter  namely Callias the son of Hipponicos and the others who went up with him; and the Argives at that very time had also sent envoys to Susa  and these asked Artoxerxes the son of Xerxes  whether the friendship which they had formed with Xerxes still remained unbroken  if they themselves desired to maintain it  or whether they were esteemed by him to be enemies; and king Artoxerxes said that it most certainly remained unbroken  and that there was no city which he considered to be more his friend than Argos.,mashup

Now whether Xerxes did indeed send a herald to Argos saying that which has been reported  and whether envoys of the Argives who had gone up to Susa inquired of Artoxerxes concerning friendship  I am not able to say for certain; nor do I declare any opinion about the matters in question other than that which the Argives themselves report: but I know this much  that if all the nations of men should bring together into one place the evils which they have suffered themselves  desiring to make exchange with their neighbours  each people of them  when they had examined closely the evils suffered by their fellows  would gladly carry away back with them those which they had brought. Thus it is not the Argives who have acted most basely of all. I however am bound to report that which is reported  though I am not bound altogether to believe it; and let this saying be considered to hold good as regards every narrative in the history: for I must add that this also is reported  namely that the Argives were actually those who invited the Persian to invade Hellas  because their war with the Lacedemonians had had an evil issue  being willing to suffer anything whatever rather than the trouble which was then upon them.,mashup

That which concerns the Argives has now been said: and meanwhile envoys had come to Sicily from the allies  to confer with Gelon  among whom was also Syagros from the Lacedemonians. Now the ancestor of this Gelon  he who was at Gela as a settler  was a native of the island of Telos  which lies off Triopion; and when Gela was founded by the Lindians of Rhodes and by Antiphemos  he was not left behind. Then in course of time his descendants became and continued to be priests of the mysteries of the Earth goddesses  an office which was acquired by Telines one of their ancestors in the following manner:— certain of the men of Gela  being worsted in a party struggle  had fled to Mactorion  the city which stands above Gela: these men Telines brought back to Gela from exile with no force of men but only with the sacred rites of these goddesses; but from whom he received them  or whether he obtained them for himself  this I am not able to say; trusting in these however  he brought the men back from exile  on the condition that his descendants should be priests of the mysteries of the goddesses. To me it has caused wonder also that Telines should have been able to perform so great a deed  considering that which I am told; for such deeds  I think  are not apt to proceed from every man  but from one who has a brave spirit and manly vigour  whereas Telines is said by the dwellers in Sicily to have been on the contrary a man of effeminate character and rather poor spirit.,mashup

He then had thus obtained the privilege of which I speak: and when Cleander the son of Pantares brought his life to an end  having been despot of Gela for seven years and being killed at last by Sabyllos a man of Gela  then Hippocrates succeeded to the monarchy  who was brother of Cleander. And while Hippocrates was despot  Gelon  who was a descendant of Telines the priest of the mysteries  was spearman of the guard to Hippocrates with many others and among them Ainesidemos the son of Pataicos. Then after no long time he was appointed by reason of valour to be commander of the whole cavalry; for when Hippocrates besieged successively the cities of Callipolis  Naxos  Zancle  Leontini  and also Syracuse and many towns of the Barbarians  in these wars Gelon showed himself a most brilliant warrior; and of the cities which I just now mentioned  not one except Syracuse escaped being reduced to subjection by Hippocrates: the Syracusans however  after they had been defeated in battle at the river Eloros  were rescued by the Corinthians and Corcyreans; these rescued them and brought the quarrel to a settlement on this condition  namely that the Syracusans should deliver up Camarina to Hippocrates. Now Camarina used in ancient time to belong to the men of Syracuse.,mashup

Then when it was the fate of Hippocrates also  after having been despot for the same number of years as his brother Cleander  to be killed at the city of Hybla  whither he had gone on an expedition against the Sikelians  then Gelon made a pretence of helping the sons of Hippocrates  Eucleides and Cleander  when the citizens were no longer willing to submit; but actually  when he had been victorious in a battle over the men of Gela  he robbed the sons of Hippocrates of the power and was ruler himself. After this stroke of fortune Gelon restored those of the Syracusans who were calledland-holders  after they had been driven into exile by the common people and by their own slaves  who were called Kyllyrians  these  I say  he restored from the city of Casmene to Syracuse  and so got possession of this last city also  for the common people of Syracuse  when Gelon came against them  delivered up to him their city and themselves.,mashup

So forthwith that city rose and shot up to prosperity; for in the first place he brought all those of Camarina to Syracuse and made them citizens  and razed to the ground the city of Camarina; then secondly he did the same to more than half of the men of Gela  as he had done to those of Camarina: and as regards the Megarians of Sicily  when they were besieged and had surrendered by capitulation  the well-to-do men of them  though they had stirred up war with him and expected to be put to death for this reason  he brought to Syracuse and made them citizens  but the common people of the Megarians  who had no share in the guilt of this war and did not expect that they would suffer any evil  these also he brought to Syracuse and sold them as slaves to be carried away from Sicily: and the same thing he did moreover to the men of Euboia in Sicily  making a distinction between them: and he dealt thus with these two cities because he thought that a body of commons was a most unpleasant element in the State.,mashup

In the manner then which has been described Gelon had become a powerful despot; and at this time when the envoys of the Hellenes had arrived at Syracuse  they came to speech with him and said as follows:The Lacedemonians and their allies sent us to get thee to be on our side against the Barbarian; for we suppose that thou art certainly informed of him who is about to invade Hellas  namely that a Persian is designing to bridge over the Hellespont  and to make an expedition against Hellas  leading against us out of Asia all the armies of the East  under colour of marching upon Athens  but in fact meaning to bring all Hellas to subjection under him. Do thou therefore  seeing that thou hast attained to a great power and hast no small portion of Hellas for thy share  being the ruler of Sicily  come to the assistance of those who are endeavouring to free Hellas  and join in making her free; for if all Hellas be gathered together in one  it forms a great body  and we are made a match in fight for those who are coming against us; but if some of us go over to the enemy and others are not willing to help  and the sound portion of Hellas is consequently small  there is at once in this a danger that all Hellas may fall to ruin. For do not thou hope that if the Persian shall overcome us in battle he will not come to thee  but guard thyself against this beforehand; for in coming to our assistance thou art helping thyself; and the matter which is wisely planned has for the most part a good issue afterwards.,mashup

The envoys spoke thus; and Gelon was very vehement with them  speaking to them as follows:Hellenes  a selfish speech is this  with which ye have ventured to come and invite me to be your ally against the Barbarian; whereas ye yourselves  when I in former time requested of you to join with me in fighting against an army of Barbarians  contention having arisen between me and the Carthaginians  and when I charged you to exact vengeance of the men of Egesta for the death of Dorieos the son of Anaxandrides  while at the same time I offered to help in setting free the trading-places  from which great advantages and gains have been reaped by you — ye  I say  then neither for my own sake came to my assistance  nor in order to exact vengeance for the death of Dorieos; and  so far as ye are concerned  all these parts are even now under the rule of Barbarians. But since it turned out well for us and came to a better issue  now that the war has come round and reached you  there has at last arisen in your minds a recollection of Gelon. However  though I have met with contempt at your hands  I will not act like you; but I am prepared to come to your assistance  supplying two hundred triremes and twenty thousand hoplites  with two thousand horsemen  two thousand bowmen  two thousand slingers and two thousand light-armed men to run beside the horsemen; and moreover I will undertake to supply corn for the whole army of the Hellenes  until we have finished the war. These things I engage to supply on this condition  namely that I shall be commander and leader of the Hellenes against the Barbarian; but on any other condition I will neither come myself nor will I send others.,mashup

Nay  but make thou no further mention of this condition  namely that we should deliver the leadership to thee; but if thou art desirous to come to the assistance of Hellas  know that thou wilt be under the command of the Lacedemonians; and if thou dost indeed claim not to be under command  come not thou to our help at all.,mashup

To this Gelon  seeing that the speech of Syagros was adverse  set forth to them his last proposal thus:Stranger from Sparta  reproaches sinking into the heart of a man are wont to rouse his spirit in anger against them; thou however  though thou hast uttered insults against me in thy speech  wilt not bring me to show myself unseemly in my reply. But whereas ye so strongly lay claim to the leadership  it were fitting that I should lay claim to it more than ye  seeing that I am the leader of an army many times as large and of ships many more. Since however this condition is so distasteful to you  we will recede somewhat from our former proposal. Suppose that ye should be leaders of the land-army and I of the fleet; or if it pleases you to lead the sea-forces  I am willing to be leader of those on land; and either ye must be contented with these terms or go away without the alliance which I have to give.,mashup

Οὕτω οὐκ ὄνειδος οὐδὲν ἡμῖν ἐστι λέγειν ταῦτα. Gelon  I say  made these offers  and the envoy of the Athenians  answering before that of the Lacedemonians  replied to him as follows:O king of the Syracusans  it was not of a leader that Hellas was in want when it sent us to thee  but of an army. Thou however dost not set before us the hope that thou wilt send an army  except thou have the leadership of Hellas; and thou art striving how thou mayest become commander of the armies of Hellas. So long then as it was thy demand to be leader of the whole army of the Hellenes  it was sufficient for us Athenians to keep silence  knowing that the Lacedemonian would be able to make defence even for us both; but now  since being repulsed from the demand for the whole thou art requesting to be commander of the naval force  we tell that thus it is:— not even if the Lacedemonian shall permit thee to be commander of it  will we permit thee; for this at least is our own  if the Lacedemonians do not themselves desire to have it. With these  if they desire to be the leaders  we do not contend; but none others beside ourselves shall we permit to be in command of the ships: for then to no purpose should we be possessors of a sea-force larger than any other which belongs to the Hellenes  if  being Athenians  we should yield the leadership to Syracusans  we who boast of a race which is the most ancient of all and who are of all the Hellenes the only people who have not changed from one land to another; to whom also belonged a man whom Homer the Epic poet said was the best of all who came to Ilion in drawing up an army and setting it in array. Thus we are not justly to be reproached if we say these things.,mashup

Now this is the meaning of the saying:— evidently the spring is the noblest part of the year; and so he meant to say that his army was the noblest part of the army of the Hellenes: for Hellas therefore  deprived of his alliance  it was  he said  as if the spring had been taken out of the year.,mashup

The envoys of the Hellenes  having thus had conference with Gelon  sailed away; and Gelon upon this  fearing on the one hand about the Hellenes  lest they should not be able to overcome the Barbarian  and on the other hand considering it monstrous and not to be endured that he should come to Peloponnesus and be under the command of the Lacedemonians  seeing that he was despot of Sicily  gave up the thought of this way and followed another: for so soon as he was informed that the Persian had crossed over the Hellespont  he sent Cadmos the son of Skythes  a man of Cos  with three fifty-oared galleys to Delphi  bearing large sums of money and friendly proposals  to wait there and see how the battle would fall out: and if the Barbarian should be victorious  he was to give him the money and also to offer him earth and water from those over whom Gelon had rule; but if the Hellenes should be victorious  he was bidden to bring it back.,mashup

Now this Cadmos before these events  having received from his father in a prosperous state the government of the people of Cos  had voluntarily and with no danger threatening  but moved merely by uprightness of nature  placed the government in the hands of the people of Cos and had departed to Sicily  where he took from the Samians and newly colonised the city of Zancle  which had changed its name to Messene. This same Cadmos  having come thither in such manner as I have said  Gelon was now sending  having selected him on account of the integrity which in other matters he had himself found to be in him; and this man  in addition to the other upright acts which had been done by him  left also this to be remembered  which was not the least of them: for having got into his hands that great sum of money which Gelon entrusted to his charge  though he might have taken possession of it himself he did not choose to do so; but when the Hellenes had got the better in the sea-fight and Xerxes had marched away and departed  he also returned to Sicily bringing back with him the whole sum of money.,mashup

The story which here follows is also reported by those who dwell in Sicily  namely that  even though he was to be under the command of the Lacedemonians  Gelon would have come to the assistance of the Hellenes  but that Terillos  the son of Crinippos and despot of Himera  having been driven out of Himera by Theron the son of Ainesidemos the ruler of the Agrigentines  was just at this very time bringing in an army of Phenicians  Libyans  Iberians  Ligurians  Elisycans  Sardinians and Corsicans  to the number of thirty myriads  with Amilcas the son of Annon king of the Carthaginians as their commander  whom Terillos had persuaded partly by reason of his own guest-friendship  and especially by the zealous assistance of Anaxilaos the son of Cretines  who was despot of Rhegion  and who to help his father-in-law endeavoured to bring in Amilcas to Sicily  and had given him his sons as hostages; for Anaxilaos was married to the daughter of Terillos  whose name was Kydippe. Thus it was  they say  that Gelon was not able to come to the assistance of the Hellenes  and sent therefore the money to Delphi.,mashup

In addition to this they report also that  as it happened  Gelon and Theron were victorious over Amilcas the Carthaginian on the very same day when the Hellenes were victorious at Salamis over the Persian. And this Amilcas  who was a Carthaginian on the father's side but on the mother's Syracusan  and who had become king of the Carthaginians by merit  when the engagement took place and he was being worsted in the battle  disappeared  as I am informed; for neither alive nor dead did he appear again anywhere upon the earth  though Gelon used all diligence in the search for him.,mashup

Moreover there is also this story reported by the Carthaginians themselves  who therein relate that which is probable in itself  namely that while the Barbarians fought with the Hellenes in Sicily from the early morning till late in the afternoon (for to such a length the combat is said to have been protracted )  during this time Amilcas was remaining in the camp and was making sacrifices to get good omens of success  offering whole bodies of victims upon a great pyre: and when he saw that there was a rout of his own army  he being then  as it chanced  in the act of pouring a libation over the victims  threw himself into the fire  and thus he was burnt up and disappeared. Amilcas then having disappeared  whether it was in such a manner as this  as it is reported by the Phenicians  or in some other way  the Carthaginians both offer sacrifices to him now  and also they made memorials of him then in all the cities of their colonies  and the greatest in Carthage itself.,mashup

So far of the affairs of Sicily: and as for the Corcyreans  they made answer to the envoys as follows  afterwards acting as I shall tell: for the same men who had gone to Sicily endeavoured also to obtain the help of these  saying the same things which they said to Gelon; and the Corcyreans at the time engaged to send a force and to help in the defence  declaring that they must not permit Hellas to be ruined without an effort on their part  for if it should suffer disaster  they would be reduced to subjection from the very first day; but they must give assistance so far as lay in their power. Thus speciously they made reply; but when the time came to send help  they manned sixty ships  having other intentions in their minds  and after making much difficulty they put out to sea and reached Peloponnese; and then near Pylos and Tainaron in the land of the Lacedemonians they kept their ships at anchor  waiting  as Gelon did  to see how the war would turn out: for they did not expect that the Hellenes would overcome  but thought that the Persian would gain the victory over them with ease and be ruler of all Hellas. Accordingly they were acting of set purpose  in order that they might be able to say to the Persian some such words as these:O king  when the Hellenes endeavoured to obtain our help for this war  we  who have a power which is not the smallest of all  and could have supplied a contingent of ships in number not the smallest  but after the Athenians the largest  did not choose to oppose thee or to do anything which was not to thy mind. By speaking thus they hoped that they would obtain some advantage over the rest  and so it would have happened  as I am of opinion: while they had for the Hellenes an excuse ready made  that namely of which they actually made use: for when the Hellenes reproached them because they did not come to help  they said that they had manned sixty triremes  but had not been able to get past Malea owing to the Etesian Winds; therefore it was that they had not come to Salamis  nor was it by any want of courage on their part that they had been left of the sea-fight.,mashup

These then evaded the request of the Hellenes thus: but the Cretans  when those of the Hellenes who had been appointed to deal with these endeavoured to obtain their help  did thus  that is to say  they joined together and sent men to inquire of the god at Delphi whether it would be better for them if they gave assistance to Hellas: and the Pythian prophetess answered:Ye fools  do ye think those woes too few  which Minos sent upon you in his wrath  because of the assistance that ye gave to Menelaos? seeing that  whereas they did not join with you in taking vengeance for his death in Camicos  ye nevertheless joined with them in taking vengeance for the woman who by a Barbarian was carried off from Sparta. When the Cretans heard this answer reported  they abstained from the giving of assistance.,mashup

For the story goes that Minos  having come to Sicania  which is now called Sicily  in search of Daidalos  died there by a violent death; and after a time the Cretans  urged thereto by a god  all except the men of Polichne and Praisos  came with a great armament to Sicania and besieged for seven years the city of Camicos  which in my time was occupied by the Agrigentines; and at last not being able either to capture it or to remain before it  because they were hard pressed by famine  they departed and went away. And when  as they sailed  they came to be off the coast of Iapygia  a great storm seized them and cast them away upon the coast; and their vessels being dashed to pieces  they  since they saw no longer any way of coming to Crete  founded there the city of Hyria; and there they stayed and were changed so that they became instead of Cretans  Messapians of Iapygia  and instead of islanders  dwellers on the mainland: then from the city of Hyria they founded those other settlements which the Tarentines long afterwards endeavoured to destroy and suffer great disaster in that enterprise  so that this in fact proved to be the greatest slaughter of Hellenes that is known to us  and not only of the Tarentines themselves but of those citizens of Rhegion who were compelled by Mikythos the son of Choiros to go to the assistance of the Tarentines  and of whom there were slain in this manner three thousand men: of the Tarentines themselves however  who were slain there  there was no numbering made. This Mikythos  who was a servant of Anaxilaos  had been left by him in charge of Rhegion; and he it was who after being driven out of Rhegion took up his abode at Tegea of the Arcadians and dedicated those many statues at Olympia.,mashup

Then after this  when they had returned home from Troy  famine and pestilence came upon both the men and their cattle  until at last Crete was stripped of its inhabitants for the second time  and a third population of Cretans now occupy it together with those which were left of the former inhabitants. The Pythian prophetess  I say  by calling these things to their minds stopped them from giving assistance to the Hellenes  though they desired to do so.,mashup

As for the Thessalians  they at first had taken the side of the Persians against their will  and they gave proof that they were not pleased by that which the Aleuadai were designing; for so soon as they heard that the Persian was about to cross over into Europe  they sent envoys to the Isthmus: now at the Isthmus were assembled representatives of Hellas chosen by the cities which had the better mind about Hellas: having come then to these  the envoys of the Thessalians said:Hellenes  ye must guard the pass by Olympos  in order that both Thessaly and the whole of Hellas may be sheltered from the war. We are prepared to join with you in guarding it  but ye must send a large force as well as we; for if ye shall not send  be assured that we shall make agreement with the Persian; since it is not right that we  standing as outposts so far in advance of the rest of Hellas  should perish alone in your defence: and not being willing to come to our help  ye cannot apply to us any force to compel inability; but we shall endeavour to devise some means of safety for ourselves.,mashup

Thus spoke the Thessalians; and the Hellenes upon this resolved to send to Thessaly by sea an army of men on foot to guard the pass: and when the army was assembled it set sail through Euripos  and having come to Alos in the Achaian land  it disembarked there and marched into Thessaly leaving the ships behind at Alos  and arrived at Tempe  the pass which leads from lower Macedonia into Thessaly by the river Peneios  going between the mountains of Olympos and Ossa. There the Hellenes encamped  being assembled to the number of about ten thousand hoplites  and to them was added the cavalry of the Thessalians; and the commander of the Lacedemonians was Euainetos the son of Carenos  who had been chosen from the polemarchs  not being of the royal house  and of the Athenians Themistocles the son of Neocles. They remained however but few days here  for envoys came from Alexander the son of Amyntas the Macedonian  who advised them to depart thence and not to remain in the pass and be trodden under foot by the invading host  signifying to them at the same time both the great numbers of the army and the ships which they had. When these gave them this counsel  they followed the advice  for they thought that the counsel was good  and the Macedonian was evidently well- disposed towards them. Also  as I think  it was fear that persuaded them to it  when they were informed that there was another pass besides this to the Thessalian land by upper Macedonia through the Perraibians and by the city of Gonnos  the way by which the army of Xerxes did in fact make its entrance. So the Hellenes went down to their ships again and made their way back to the Isthmus.,mashup

Such was the expedition to Thessaly  which took place when the king was about to cross over from Asia to Europe and was already at Abydos.

When the Hellenes had returned to the Isthmus  they deliberated  having regard to that which had been said by Alexander  where and in what regions they should set the war on foot: and the opinion which prevailed was to guard the pass at Thermopylai; for it was seen to be narrower than that leading into Thessaly  and at the same time it was single  and nearer also to their own land; and as for the path by means of which were taken those of the Hellenes who were taken by the enemy at Thermopylai  they did not even know of its existence until they were informed by the people of Trachis after they had come to Thermopylai. This pass then they resolved to guard  and not permit the Barbarian to go by into Hellas; and they resolved that the fleet should sail to Artemision in the territory of Histiaia: for these points are near to one another  so that each division of their forces could have information of what was happening to the other. And the places are so situated as I shall describe.,mashup

As to Artemision first  coming out of the Thracian Sea the space is contracted from great width to that narrow channel which lies between the island of Skiathos and the mainland of Magnesia; and after the strait there follows at once in Euboea the sea-beach called Artemision  upon which there is a temple of Artemis. Then secondly the passage into Hellas by Trechis is  where it is narrowest  but fifty feet wide: it is not here however that the narrowest part of this whole region lies  but in front of Thermopylai and also behind it  consisting of a single wheel- track only both by Alpenoi  which lies behind Thermopylai and again by the river Phoinix near the town of Anthela there is no space but a single wheel-track only: and on the West of Thermopylai there is a mountain which is impassable and precipitous  rising up to a great height and extending towards the range of Oite  while on the East of the road the sea with swampy pools succeeds at once. In this passage there are hot springs  which the natives of the place call thePots  and an altar of Heracles is set up near them. Moreover a wall had once been built at this pass  and in old times there was a gate set in it; which wall was built by the Phokians  who were struck with fear because the Thessalians had come from the land of the Thesprotians to settle in the Aiolian land  the same which they now possess. Since then the Thessalians  as they supposed  were attempting to subdue them  the Phokians guarded themselves against this beforehand; and at that time they let the water of the hot springs run over the passage  that the place might be converted into a ravine  and devised every means that the Thessalians might not make invasion of their land. Now the ancient wall had been built long before  and the greater part of it was by that time in ruins from lapse of time; the Hellenes however resolved to set it up again  and at this spot to repel the Barbarian from Hellas: and very near the road there is a village called Alpenoi  from which the Hellenes counted on getting supplies.,mashup

The Hellenes  I say  were coming to the rescue with speed  having been appointed to their several places: and meanwhile the men of Delphi consulted the Oracle of the god on behalf of themselves and on behalf of Hellas  being struck with dread; and a reply was given them that they should pray to the Winds  for these would be powerful helpers of Hellas in fight. So the Delphians  having accepted the oracle  first reported the answer which had been given them to those of the Hellenes who desired to be free; and having reported this to them at a time when they were in great dread of the Barbarian  they laid up for themselves an immortal store of gratitude: then after this the men of Delphi established an altar for the Winds in Thuia  where is the sacred enclosure of Thuia the daughter of Kephisos  after whom moreover this place has its name; and also they approached them with sacrifices.,mashup

The ship of Egina however  of which Asonides was master  even gave them some trouble to capture it  seeing that Pytheas the son of Ischeno�s served as a fighting-man on board of her  who proved himself a most valiant man on this day; for when the ship was being taken  he held out fighting until he was hacked all to pieces: and as when he had fallen he did not die  but had still breath in him  the Persians who served as fighting-men on board the ships  because of his valour used all diligence to save his life  both applying unguents of myrrh to heal his wounds and also wrapping him up in bands of the finest linen; and when they came back to their own main body  they showed him to all the army  making a marvel of him and giving him good treatment; but the rest whom they had taken in this ship they treated as slaves.,mashup

Two of the three ships  I say  were captured thus; but the third  of which Phormos an Athenian was master  ran ashore in its flight at the mouth of the river Peneios; and the Barbarians got possession of the vessel but not of the crew; for so soon as the Athenians had run the ship ashore  they leapt out of her  and passing through Thessaly made their way to Athens.,mashup

Of these things the Hellenes who were stationed at Artemision were informed by fire-signals from Skiathos; and being informed of them and being struck with fear  they removed their place of anchorage from Atermision to Chalkis  intending to guard the Euripos  but leaving at the same time watchers by day on the heights of Euboea. Of the ten ships of the Barbarians three sailed up to the reef called Myrmex  which lies between Skiathos and Magnesia; and when the Barbarians had there erected a stone pillar  which for that purpose they brought to the reef  they set forth with their main body from Therma  the difficulties of the passage having now been cleared away  and sailed thither with all their ships  having let eleven days go by since the king set forth on his march from Therma. Now of this reef lying exactly in the middle of the fairway they were informed by Pammon of Skyros. Sailing then throughout the day the Barbarians accomplished the voyage to Sepias in Magnesia and to the sea-beach which is between the city of Casthanaia and the headland of Sepias.,mashup

So far as this place and so far as Thermopylai the army was exempt from calamity; and the number was then still  as I find by computation  this:— Of the ships which came from Asia  which were one thousand two hundred and seven  the original number of the crews supplied by the several nations I find to have been twenty-four myriads and also in addition to them one thousand four hundred  if one reckons at the rate of two hundred men to each ship: and on board of each of these ships there served as fighting-men  besides the fighting-men belonging to its own nation in each case  thirty men who were Persians  Medes  or Sacans; and this amounts to three myriads six thousand two hundred and ten in addition to the others. I will add also to this and to the former number the crews of the fifty-oared galleys  assuming that there were eighty men  more or less  in each one. Of these vessels there were gathered together  as was before said  three thousand: it would follow therefore that there were in them four-and-twenty myriads of men. This was the naval force which came from Asia  amounting in all to fifty-one myriads and also seven thousand six hundred and ten in addition. Then of the footmen there had been found to be a hundred and seventy myriads  and of the horsemen eight myriads: and I will add also to these the Arabian camel-drivers and the Libyan drivers of chariots  assuming them to amount to twenty thousand men. The result is then that the number of the ships' crews combined with that of the land-army amounts to two hundred and thirty-one myriads and also in addition seven thousand six hundred and ten. This is the statement of the Army which was brought up out of Asia itself  without counting the attendants which accompanied it or the corn-transports and the men who sailed in these.,mashup

There is still to be reckoned  in addition to all this which has been summed up  the force which was being led from Europe; and of this we must give a probable estimate. The Hellenes of Thrace and of the islands which lie off the coast of Thrace supplied a hundred and twenty ships; from which ships there results a sum of twenty-four thousand men: and as regards the land-force which was supplied by the Thracians  Paionians  Eordians  Bottiaians  the race which inhabits Chalkidike  the Brygians  Pierians  Macedonians  Perraibians  Enianians  Dolopians  Magnesians  Achaians  and all those who dwell in the coast- region of Thrace  of these various nations I estimate that there were thirty myriads. These myriads then added to those from Asia make a total sum of two hundred and sixty-four myriads of fighting men and in addition to these sixteen hundred and ten.,mashup

Such being the number of this body of fighting-men  the attendants who went with these and the men who were in the small vessels which carried corn  and again in the other vessels which sailed with the army  these I suppose were not less in number but more than the fighting men. I assume them to be equal in number with these  and neither at all more nor less; and so  being supposed equal in number with the fighting body  they make up the same number of myriads as they. Thus five hundred and twenty-eight myriads three thousand two hundred and twenty was the number of men whom Xerxes son of Dareios led as far as Sepias and Thermopylai.,mashup

For that night they lay thus; but at early dawn  after clear sky and windless calm  the sea began to be violently agitated and a great storm fell upon them with a strong East Wind  that wind which they who dwell about those parts call Hellespontias. Now as many of them as perceived that the wind was rising and who were so moored that it was possible for them to do so  drew up their ships on land before the storm came  and both they and their ships escaped; but as for those of the ships which it caught out at sea  some it cast away at the place called Ipnoi in Pelion and others on the beach  while some were wrecked on the headland of Sepias itself  others at the city of Meliboia  and others were thrown up on shore at Casthanaia: and the violence of the storm could not be resisted.,mashup

There is a story reported that the Athenians had called upon Boreas to aid them  by suggestion of an oracle  because there had come to them another utterance of the god bidding them call upon their brother by marriage to be their helper. Now according to the story of the Hellenes Boreas has a wife who is of Attica  Oreithuia the daughter of Erechththeus. By reason of this affinity  I say  the Athenians  according to the tale which has gone abroad  conjectured that theirbrother by marriage was Boreas  and when they perceived the wind rising  as they lay with their ships at Chalkis in Euboea  or even before that  they offered sacrifices and called upon Boreas and Oreithuia to assist them and to destroy the ships of the Barbarians  as they had done before round about mount Athos. Whether it was for this reason that the wind Boreas fell upon the Barbarians while they lay at anchor  I am not able to say; but however that may be  the Athenians report that Boreas had come to their help in former times  and that at this time he accomplished those things for them of which I speak; and when they had returned home they set up a temple dedicated to Boreas by the river Ilissos.,mashup

They  I say  came for the second time and lay with their ships about Artemision: and from that time even to this they preserve the use of the surnameSaviour for Poseidon. Meanwhile the Barbarians  when the wind had ceased and the swell of the sea had calmed down  drew their ships into the sea and sailed on along the shore of the mainland  and having rounded the extremity of Magnesia they sailed straight into the gulf which leads towards Pagasai. In this gulf of Magnesia there is a place where it is said that Heracles was left behind by Jason and his comrades  having been sent from the Argo to fetch water  at the time when they were sailing for the fleece to Aia in the land of Colchis: for from that place they designed  when they had taken in water  to loose their ship into the open sea; and from this the place has come to have the name Aphetai. Here then the fleet of Xerxes took up its moorings.,mashup

Now it chanced that fifteen of these ships put out to sea a good deal later than the rest  and they happened to catch sight of the ships of the Hellenes at Artemision. These ships the Barbarians supposed to be their own  and they sailed thither accordingly and fell among the enemy. Of these the commander was Sandokes the son of Thamasios  the governor of Kyme in Aiolia  whom before this time king Dareios had taken and crucified (he being one of the Royal Judges ) for this reason  namely that Sandokes had pronounced judgment unjustly for money. So then after he was hung up  Dareios reckoned and found that more good services had been done by him to the royal house than were equal to his offences; and having found this  and perceived that he had himself acted with more haste than wisdom  he let him go. Thus he escaped from king Dareios  and did not perish but survived; now  however  when he sailed in toward the Hellenes  he was destined not to escape the second time; for when the Hellenes saw them sailing up  perceiving the mistake which was being made they put out against them and captured them without difficulty.,mashup

They related moreover in addition to this  that many of these who were about to be sacrificed had before now run away and departed to another land  because they were afraid; and if afterwards in course of time they returned to their own land and were caught  they were placed in the City Hall: and they told how the man is sacrificed all thickly covered with wreaths  and with what form of procession he is brought forth to the sacrifice. This is done to the descendants of Kytissoros the son of Phrixos  because  when the Achaians were making of Athamas the son of Aiolos a victim to purge the sins of the land according to the command of an oracle  and were just about to sacrifice him  this Kytissoros coming from Aia of the Colchians rescued him; and having done so he brought the wrath of the gods upon his own descendants. Having heard these things  Xerxes  when he came to the sacred grove  both abstained from entering it himself  and gave the command to his whole army to so likewise; and he paid reverence both to the house and to the sacred enclosure of the descendants of Athamas.,mashup

These  I say  had intended to do thus: and meanwhile the Hellenes at Thermopylai  when the Persian had come near to the pass  were in dread  and deliberated about making retreat from their position. To the rest of the Peloponnesians then it seemed best that they should go to the Peloponnese and hold the Isthmus in guard; but Leonidas  when the Phokians and Locrians were indignant at this opinion  gave his vote for remaining there  and for sending at the same time messengers to the several States bidding them to come up to help them  since they were but few to repel the army of the Medes.,mashup

And when the horseman had ridden up towards their camp  he looked upon them and had a view not indeed of the whole of their army  for of those which were posted within the wall  which they had repaired and were keeping a guard  it was not possible to have a view  but he observed those who were outside  whose station was in front of the wall; and it chanced at that time that the Lacedemonians were they who were posted outside. So then he saw some of the men practising athletic exercises and some combing their long hair: and as he looked upon these things he marvelled  and at the same time he observed their number: and when he had observed all exactly  he rode back unmolested  for no one attempted to pursue him and he found himself treated with much indifference. And when he returned he reported to Xerxes all that which he had seen.,mashup

Hearing this Xerxes was not able to conjecture the truth about the matter  namely that they were preparing themselves to die and to deal death to the enemy so far as they might; but it seemed to him that they were acting in a manner merely ridiculous; and therefore he sent for Demaratos the son of Ariston  who was in his camp  and when he came  Xerxes asked him of these things severally  desiring to discover what this was which the Lacedemonians were doing: and he said:Thou didst hear from my mouth at a former time  when we were setting forth to go against Hellas  the things concerning these men; and having heard them thou madest me an object of laughter  because I told thee of these things which I perceived would come to pass; for to me it is the greatest of all ends to speak the truth continually before thee  O king. Hear then now also: these men have come to fight with us for the passage  and this is it that they are preparing to do; for they have a custom which is as follows;— whenever they are about to put their lives in peril  then they attend to the arrangement of their hair. Be assured however  that if thou shalt subdue these and the rest of them which remain behind in Sparta  there is no other race of men which will await thy onset  O king  or will raise hands against thee: for now thou art about to fight against the noblest kingdom and city of those which are among the Hellenes  and the best men. To Xerxes that which was said seemed to be utterly incredible  and he asked again a second time in what manner being so few they would fight with his host. He said;O king  deal with me as with a liar  if thou find not that these things come to pass as I say.,mashup

Thus saying he did not convince Xerxes  who let four days go by  expecting always that they would take to flight; but on the fifth day  when they did not depart but remained  being obstinate  as he thought  in impudence and folly  he was enraged and sent against them the Medes and the Kissians  charging them to take the men alive and bring them into his presence. Then when the Medes moved forward and attacked the Hellenes  there fell many of them  and others kept coming up continually  and they were not driven back  though suffering great loss: and they made it evident to every man  and to the king himself not least of all  that human beings are many but men are few.

When however these also engaged in combat with the Hellenes  they gained no more success than the Median troops but the same as they  seeing that they were fighting in a place with a narrow passage  using shorter spears than the Hellenes  and not being able to take advantage of their superior numbers. The Lacedemonians meanwhile were fighting in a memorable fashion  and besides other things of which they made display  being men perfectly skilled in fighting opposed to men who were unskilled  they would turn their backs to the enemy and make a pretence of taking to flight; and the Barbarians  seeing them thus taking a flight  would follow after them with shouting and clashing of arms: then the Lacedemonians  when they were being caught up  turned and faced the Barbarians; and thus turning round they would slay innumerable multitudes of the Persians; and there fell also at these times a few of the Spartans themselves. So  as the Persians were not able to obtain any success by making trial of the entrance and attacking it by divisions and every way  they retired back.,mashup

And during these onsets it is said that the king  looking on  three times leapt up from his seat  struck with fear for his army. Thus they contended then: and on the following day the Barbarians strove with no better success; for because the men opposed to them were few in number  they engaged in battle with the expectation that they would be found to be disabled and would not be capable any longer of raising their hands against them in fight. The Hellenes however were ordered by companies as well as by nations  and they fought successively each in turn  excepting the Phokians  for these were posted upon the mountain to guard the path. So the Persians  finding nothing different from that which they had seen on the former day  retired back from the fight.,mashup

Then when the king was in a strait as to what he should do in the matter before him  Epialtes the son of Eurydemos  a Malian  came to speech with him  supposing that he would win a very great reward from the king; and this man told him of the path which leads over the mountain to Thermopylai  and brought about the destruction of those Hellenes who remained in that place. Afterwards from fear of the Lacedemonians he fled to Thessaly  and when he had fled  a price was proclaimed for his life by the Deputies  when the Amphictyons met for their assembly at Pylai. Then some time afterwards having returned to Antikyra he was slain by Athenades a man of Trachis. Now this Athenades killed Epialtes for another cause  which I shall set forth in the following part of the history  but he was honoured for it none the less by the Lacedemonians.,mashup

Thus Epialtes after these events was slain: there is however another tale told  that Onetes the son of Phanagoras  a man of Carystos  and Corydallos of Antikyra were those who showed the Persians the way round the mountain; but this I can by no means accept: for first we must judge by this fact  namely that the Deputies of the Hellenes did not proclaim a price for the lives of Onetes and Corydallos  but for that of Epialtes the Trachinian  having surely obtained the most exact information of the matter; and secondly we know that Epialtes was an exile from his country to avoid this charge. True it is indeed that Onetes might know of this path  even though he were not a Malian  if he had had much intercourse with the country; but Epialtes it was who led them round the mountain by the path  and him therefore I write down as the guilty man.,mashup

Xerxes accordingly  being pleased by that which Epialtes engaged to accomplish  at once with great joy proceeded to send Hydarnes and the men of whom Hydarnes was commander; and they set forth from the camp about the time when the lamps are lit. This path of which we speak had been discovered by the Malians who dwell in that land  and having discovered it they led the Thessalians by it against the Phokians  at the time when the Phokians had fenced the pass with a wall and thus were sheltered from the attacks upon them: so long ago as this had the pass been proved by the Malians to be of no value.,mashup

In this part of the mountain there were  as I have before shown  a thousand hoplites of the Phokians keeping guard  to protect their own country and to keep the path: for while the pass below was guarded by those whom I have mentioned  the path over the mountain was guarded by the Phokians  who had undertaken the business for Leonidas by their own offer.,mashup

These  when they saw men arming themselves  fell into wonder  for they were expecting that no one would appear to oppose them  and instead of that they had met with an armed force. Then Hydarnes  seized with fear lest the Phokians should be Lacedemonians  asked Epialtes of what people the force was; and being accurately informed he set the Persians in order for battle. The Phokians however  when they were hit by the arrows of the enemy  which flew thickly  fled and got away at once to the topmost peak of the mountain  fully assured that it was against them that the enemy had designed to come  and here they were ready to meet death. These  I say  were in this mind; but the Persians meanwhile with Epialtes and Hydarnes made no account of the Phokians  but descended the mountain with all speed.,mashup

However it is reported also that Leonidas himself sent them away  having a care that they might not perish  but thinking that it was not seemly for himself and for the Spartans who were present to leave the post to which they had come at first to keep guard there. I am inclined rather to be of this latter opinion  namely that because Leonidas perceived that the allies were out of heart and did not desire to face the danger with him to the end  he ordered them to depart  but held that for himself to go away was not honourable  whereas if he remained  a great fame of him would be left behind  and the prosperity of Sparta would not be blotted out: for an oracle had been given by the Pythian prophetess to the Spartans  when they consulted about this war at the time when it was being first set on foot  to the effect that either Lacedemon must be destroyed by the Barbarians  or their king must lose his life. This reply the prophetess gave them in hexameter verses  and it ran thus:But as for you  ye men who in wide-spaced Sparta inhabit  Either your glorious city is sacked by the children of Perses  Or  if it be not so  then a king of the stock Heracleian Dead shall be mourned for by all in the boundaries of broad Lacedemon. Him nor the might of bulls nor the raging of lions shall hinder; For he hath might as of Zeus; and I say he shall not be restrained  Till one of the other of these he have utterly torn and divided. I am of opinion that Leonidas considering these things and desiring to lay up for himself glory above all the other Spartans  dismissed the allies  rather than that those who departed did so in such disorderly fashion  because they were divided in opinion.,mashup

Of this the following has been to my mind a proof as convincing as any other  namely that Leonidas is known to have endeavoured to dismiss the soothsayer also who accompanied this army  Megistias the Acarnanian  who was said to be descended from Melampus  that he might not perish with them after he had declared from the victims that which was about to come to pass for them. He however when he was bidden to go would not himself depart  but sent away his son who was with him in the army  besides whom he had no other child.,mashup

The allies then who were dismissed departed and went away  obeying the word of Leonidas  and only the Thespians and the Thebans remained behind with the Lacedemonians. Of these the Thebans stayed against their will and not because they desired it  for Leonidas kept them  counting them as hostages; but the Thespians very willingly  for they said that they would not depart and leave Leonidas and those with him  but they stayed behind and died with them.

Xerxes meanwhile  having made libations at sunrise  stayed for some time  until about the hour when the market fills  and then made an advance upon them; for thus it had been enjoined by Epialtes  seeing that the descent of the mountain is shorter and the space to be passed over much less than the going round and the ascent. The Barbarians accordingly with Xerxes were advancing to the attack; and the Hellenes with Leonidas  feeling that they were going forth to death  now advanced out much further than at first into the broader part of the defile; for when the fence of the wall was being guarded  they on the former days fought retiring before the enemy into the narrow part of the pass; but now they engaged with them outside the narrows  and very many of the Barbarians fell: for behind them the leaders of the divisions with scourges in their hands were striking each man  ever urging them on to the front. Many of them then were driven into the sea and perished  and many more still were trodden down while yet alive by one another  and there was no reckoning of the number that perished: for knowing the death which was about to come upon them by reason of those who were going round the mountain  they displayed upon the Barbarians all the strength which they had  to its greatest extent  disregarding danger and acting as if possessed by a spirit of recklessness.,mashup

Now by this time the spears of the greater number of them were broken  so it chanced  in this combat  and they were slaying the Persians with their swords; and in this fighting fell Leonidas  having proved himself a very good man  and others also of the Spartans with him  men of note  of whose names I was informed as of men who had proved themselves worthy  and indeed I was told also the names of all the three hundred. Moreover of the Persians there fell here  besides many others of note  especially two sons of Dareios  Abrocomes and Hyperanthes  born to Dareios of Phratagune the daughter of Artanes: now Artanes was the brother of king Dareios and the son of Hystaspes  the son of Arsames; and he in giving his daughter in marriage to Dareios gave also with her all his substance  because she was his only child.,mashup

Two brothers of Xerxes  I say  fell here fighting; and meanwhile over the body of Leonidas there arose a great struggle between the Persians and the Lacedemonians  until the Hellenes by valour dragged this away from the enemy and turned their opponents to flight four times. This conflict continued until those who had gone with Epialtes came up; and when the Hellenes learnt that these had come  from that moment the nature of the combat was changed; for they retired backwards to the narrow part of the way  and having passed by the wall they went and placed themselves upon the hillock  all in a body together except only the Thebans: now this hillock is in the entrance  where now the stone lion is placed for Leonidas. On this spot while defending themselves with daggers  that is those who still had them left  and also with hands and with teeth  they were overwhelmed by the missiles of the Barbarians  some of these having followed directly after them and destroyed the fence of the wall  while others had come round and stood about them on all sides.,mashup

Two of these three hundred  it is said  namely Eurystos and Aristodemos  who  if they had made agreement with one another  might either have come safe home to Sparta together (seeing that they had been dismissed from the camp by Leonidas and were lying at Alpenoi with disease of the eyes  suffering extremely )  or again  if they had not wished to return home  they might have been slain together with the rest — when they might  I say  have done either one of these two things  would not agree together; but the two being divided in opinion  Eurystos  it is said  when he was informed that the Persians had gone round  asked for his arms and having put them on ordered his Helot to lead him to those who were fighting; and after he had led him thither  the man who had led him ran away and departed  but Eurystos plunged into the thick of the fighting  and so lost his life: but Aristodemos was left behind fainting. Now if either Aristodemos had been ill alone  and so had returned home to Sparta  or the men had both of them come back together  I do not suppose that the Spartans would have displayed any anger against them; but in this case  as the one of them had lost his life and the other  clinging to an excuse which the first also might have used  had not been willing to die  it necessarily happened that the Spartans had great indignation against Aristodemos.,mashup

Thus did the Hellenes at Thermopylai contend in fight; and Xerxes summoned Demaratos and inquired of him  having first said this:Demaratos  thou art a good man; and this I conclude by the truth of thy words  for all that thou saidest turned out so as thou didst say. Now  however  tell me how many in number are the remaining Lacedemonians  and of them how many are like these in matters of war; or are they so even all of them ? He said:O king  the number of all the Lacedemonians is great and their cities are many  but that which thou desirest to learn  thou shalt know. There is in Lacedemon the city of Sparta  having about eight thousand men; and these are all equal to those who fought here: the other Lacedemonians are not equal to these  but they are good men too. To this Xerxes said:Demaratos  in what manner shall we with least labour get the better of these men? Come set forth to us this; for thou knowest the courses of their counsels  seeing that thou wert once their king.,mashup

What if thou shouldest send three hundred ships from thy fleet to attack the Laconian land? Now there is lying near it an island named Kythera  about which Chilon  who was a very wise man among us  said that it would be a greater gain for the Spartans that it should be sunk under the sea than that it should remain above it; for he always anticipated that something would happen from it of such a kind as I am now setting forth to thee: not that he knew of thy armament beforehand  but that he feared equally every armament of men. Let thy forces then set forth from this island and keep the Lacedemonians in fear; and while they have a war of their own close at their doors  there will be no fear for thee from them that when the remainder of Hellas is being conquered by the land-army  they will come to the rescue there. Then after the remainder of Hellas has been reduced to subjection  from that moment the Lacedemonian power will be left alone and therefore feeble. If however thou shalt not do this  I will tell thee what thou must look for. There is a narrow isthmus leading to the Peloponnese  and in this place thou must look that other battles will be fought more severe than those which have taken place  seeing that all the Peloponnesians have sworn to a league against thee: but if thou shalt do the other thing of which I spoke  this isthmus and the cities within it will come over to thy side without a battle.,mashup

After him spoke Achaimenes  brother of Xerxes and also commander of the fleet  who chanced to have been present at this discourse and was afraid lest Xerxes should be persuaded to do this:O king  he said I see that thou art admitting the speech of a man who envies thy good fortune  or is even a traitor to thy cause: for in truth the Hellenes delight in such a temper as this; they envy a man for his good luck  and they hate that which is stronger than themselves. And if  besides other misfortunes which we have upon us  seeing that four hundred of our ships have suffered wreck  thou shalt send away another three hundred from the station of the fleet to sail round Peloponnese  then thy antagonists become a match for thee in fight; whereas while it is all assembled together our fleet is hard for them to deal with  and they will not be at all a match for thee: and moreover the whole sea- force will support the land-force and be supported by it  if they proceed onwards together; but if thou shalt divide them  neither wilt thou be of service to them nor they to thee. My determination is rather to set thy affairs in good order and not to consider the affairs of the enemy  either where they will set on foot the war or what they will do or how many in number they are; for it is sufficient that they should themselves take thought for themselves  and we for ourselves likewise: and if the Lacedemonians come to stand against the Persians in fight  they will assuredly not heal the wound from which they are now suffering.,mashup

Having thus said Xerxes passed in review the bodies of the dead; and as for Leonidas  hearing that he had been the king and commander of the Lacedemonians he bade them cut off his head and crucify him. And it has been made plain to me by many proofs besides  but by none more strongly than by this  that king Xerxes was enraged with Leonidas while alive more than with any other man on earth; for otherwise he would never have done this outrage to his corpse; since of all the men whom I know  the Persians are accustomed most to honour those who are good men in war.

The Lacedemonians had been informed before all others that the king was preparing an expedition against Hellas; and thus it happened that they sent to the Oracle at Delphi  where that reply was given them which I reported shortly before this. And they got this information in a strange manner; for Demaratos the son of Ariston after he had fled for refuge to the Medes was not friendly to the Lacedemonians  as I am of opinion and as likelihood suggests supporting my opinion; but it is open to any man to make conjecture whether he did this thing which follows in a friendly spirit or in malicious triumph over them. When Xerxes had resolved to make a campaign against Hellas  Demaratos  being in Susa and having been informed of this  had a desire to report it to the Lacedemonians. Now in no other way was he able to signify it  for there was danger that he should be discovered  but he contrived thus  that is to say  he took a folding tablet and scraped off the wax which was upon it  and then he wrote the design of the king upon the wood of the tablet  and having done so he melted the wax and poured it over the writing  so that the tablet (being carried without writing upon it ) might not cause any trouble to be given by the keepers of the road. Then when it had arrived at Lacedemon  the Lacedemonians were not able to make conjecture of the matter; until at last  as I am informed  Gorgo  the daughter of Cleomenes and wife of Leonidas  suggested a plan of which she had herself thought  bidding them scrape the wax and they would find writing upon the wood; and doing as she said they found the writing and read it  and after that they sent notice to the other Hellenes. These things are said to have come to pass in this manner.,mashup

So as the allies opposed this  the Athenians yielded  having it much at heart that Hellas should be saved  and perceiving that if they should have disagreement with one another about the leadership  Hellas would perish: and herein they judged rightly  for disagreement between those of the same race is worse than war undertaken with one consent by as much as war is worse than peace. Being assured then of this truth  they did not contend  but gave way for so long time as they were urgently in need of the allies; and that this was so their conduct proved; for when  after repelling the Persian from themselves  they were now contending for his land and no longer for their own  they alleged the insolence of Pausanias as a pretext and took away the leadership from the Lacedemonians. This however took place afterwards.,mashup

But at this time these Hellenes also who had come to Artemision  when they saw that a great number of ships had put in to Aphetai and that everything was filled with their armament  were struck with fear  because the fortunes of the Barbarians had different issue from that which they expected  and they deliberated about retreating from Artemision to the inner parts of Hellas. And the Euboeans perceiving that they were so deliberating  asked Eurybiades to stay there by them for a short time  until they should have removed out of their land their children  and their households; and as they did not persuade him  they went elsewhere and persuaded Themistocles the commander of the Athenians by a payment of thirty talents  the condition being that the fleet should stay and fight the sea-battle in front of Euboea.,mashup

Themistocles then caused the Hellenes to stay in the following manner:— to Eurybiades he imparted five talents of the sum with the pretence that he was giving it from himself; and when Eurybiades had been persuaded by him to change his resolution  Adeimantos son of Okytos  the Corinthian commander  was the only one of all the others who still made a struggle  saying that he would sail away from Artemision and would not stay with the others: to him therefore Themistocles said with an oath:Thou at least shalt not leave us  for I will give thee greater gifts than the king of the Medes would send to thee  if thou shouldest desert thy allies. Thus he spoke  and at the same time he sent to the ship of Adeimantos three talents of silver. So these all had been persuaded by gifts to change their resolution  and at the same time the request of the Euboeans had been gratified and Themistocles himself gained money; and it was not known that he had the rest of the money  but those who received a share of this money were fully persuaded that it had come from the Athenian State for this purpose.,mashup

Thus they remained in Euboea and fought a sea-battle; and it came to pass as follows:— when the Barbarians had arrived at Aphetai about the beginning of the afternoon  having been informed even before they came that a few ships of the Hellenes were stationed about Artemision and now seeing them for themselves  they were eager to attack them  to see if they could capture them. Now they did not think it good yet to sail against them directly for this reason — for fear namely that the Hellenes  when they saw them sailing against them  should set forth to take flight and darkness should come upon them in their flight; and so they were likely (thought the Persians ) to get away; whereas it was right  according to their calculation  that not even the fire- bearer should escape and save his life.,mashup

Having formed this plan they proceeded to send off the ships which were appointed for this  and they themselves had no design of attacking the Hellenes on that day nor until the signal agreed upon should be displayed to them by those who were sailing round  to show that they had arrived. These ships  I say  they were sending round  and meanwhile they were numbering the rest at Aphetai.,mashup

During this time  while these were numbering their ships  it happened thus:— there was in that camp a man of Skione named Skyllias  as a diver the best of all the men of that time  who also in the shipwreck which took place by Pelion had saved for the Persians many of their goods and many of them also he had acquired for himself: this Skyllias it appears had had an intention even before this of deserting to the side of the Hellenes  but it had not been possible for him to do so then. In what manner after this attempt he did actually come to the Hellenes  I am not able to say with certainty  but I marvel if the tale is true which is reported; for it is said that he dived into the sea at Aphetai and did not come up till he reached Artemision  having traversed here somewhere about eighty furlongs through the sea. Now there are told about this man several other tales which seem likely to be false  but some also which are true: about this matter however let it be stated as my opinion that he came to Artemision in a boat. Then when he had come  he forthwith informed the commanders about the shipwreck  how it had come to pass  and of the ships which had been sent away to go round Euboea.,mashup

Hearing this the Hellenes considered the matter with one another; and after many things had been spoken  the prevailing opinion was that they should remain there that day and encamp on shore  and then  when midnight was past  they should set forth and go to meet those ships which were sailing round. After this however  as no one sailed out to attack them  they waited for the coming of the late hours of the afternoon and sailed out themselves to attack the Barbarians  desiring to make a trial both of their manner of fighting and of the trick of breaking their line.,mashup

And seeing them sailing thus against them with few ships  not only the others in the army of Xerxes but also their commanders judged them to be moved by mere madness  and they themselves also put out their ships to sea  supposing that they would easily capture them: and their expectation was reasonable enough  since they saw that the ships of the Hellenes were few  while theirs were many times as numerous and sailed better. Setting their mind then on this  they came round and enclosed them in the middle. Then so many of the Ionians as were kindly disposed to the Hellenes and were serving in the expedition against their will  counted it a matter of great grief to themselves when they saw them being surrounded and felt assured that not one of them would return home  so feeble did they think the power of the Hellenes to be; while those to whom that which was happening was a source of pleasure  were vying with one another  each one endeavouring to be the first to take an Athenian ship and receive gifts from the king: for in their camps there was more report of the Athenians than of any others.,mashup

The Hellenes meanwhile  when the signal was given  first set themselves with prows facing the Barbarians and drew the sterns of their ships together in the middle; and when the signal was given a second time  although shut off in a small space and prow against prow  they set to work vigorously; and they captured thirty ships of the Barbarians and also Philaon the son of Chersis  the brother of Gorgos kind of the Salaminians  who was a man of great repute in the army. Now the first of the Hellenes who captured a ship of the enemy was an Athenian  Lycomedes the son of Aischraios  and he received the prize for valour. So these  as they were contending in this sea-fight with doubtful result  were parted from one another by the coming on of night. The Hellenes accordingly sailed away to Artemision and the Barbarians to Aphetai  the contest having been widely different from their expectation. In this sea-fight Antidoros of Lemnos alone of the Hellenes who were with the king deserted to the side of the Hellenes  and the Athenians on account of this deed gave him a piece of land in Salamis.,mashup

These then had such a night as I have said; and meanwhile those of them who had been appointed to sail round Euboea experienced the very same night  but against them it raged much more fiercely  inasmuch as it fell upon them while they were making their course in the open sea. And the end of it proved distressful to them; for when the storm and the rain together came upon them as they sailed  being then off theHollows of Euboea  they were borne by the wind not knowing by what way they were carried  and were cast away upon the rocks. And all this was being brought about by God in order that the Persian force might be made more equal to that of the Hellenes and might not be by very much the larger.,mashup

The coming of these gave them more courage  and at the same time they were encouraged also by a report that those of the Barbarians who had been sailing round Euboea had all been destroyed by the storm that had taken place. They waited then for the same time of day as before  and then they sailed and fell upon some Kilikian ships; and having destroyed these  they sailed away when the darkness came on  and returned to Artemision.,mashup

On the third day the commanders of the Barbarians  being exceedingly indignant that so small a number of ships should thus do them damage  and fearing what Xerxes might do  did not wait this time for the Hellenes to begin the fight  but passed the word of command and put out their ships to sea about the middle of the day. Now it so happened that these battles at sea and the battles on land at Thermopylai took place on the same days; and for those who fought by sea the whole aim of the fighting was concerned with the channel of Euripos  just as the aim of Leonidas and of his band was to guard the pass: the Hellenes accordingly exhorted one another not to let the Barbarians go by into Hellas; while these cheered one another on to destroy the fleet of the Hellenes and to get possession of the straits.,mashup

Then the Hellenes put out to sea and engaged with them; and in this battle the two sides were nearly equal to one another; for the fleet of Xerxes by reason of its great size and numbers suffered damage from itself  since the ships were thrown into confusion and ran into one another: nevertheless it stood out and did not give way  for they disdained to be turned to flight by so few ships. Many ships therefore of the Hellenes were destroyed and many men perished  but many more ships and men of the Barbarians. Thus contending they parted and went each to their own place.,mashup

Themistocles however had conceived that if there should be detached from the force of the Barbarians the Ionian and Carian nations  they would be able to overcome the rest; and when the people of Euboea were driving their flocks down to that sea  he assembled the generals and said to them that he thought he had a device by which he hoped to cause the best of the king's allies to leave him. This matter he revealed to that extent only; and with regard to their present circumstances  he said that they must do as follows:— every one must slaughter of the flocks of the Euboeans as many as he wanted  for it was better that their army should have them than the enemy; moreover he advised that each one should command his own men to kindle a fire: and as for the time of their departure he would see to it in such wise that they should come safe to Hellas. This they were content to do  and forthwith when they had kindled a fire they turned their attention to the flocks.,mashup

While these were thus engaged  there came to them the scout from Trachis: for there was at Artemision a scout named Polyas  by birth of Antikyra  to whom it had been appointed  if the fleet should be disabled  to signify this to those at Thermopylai  and he had a vessel equipped and ready for this purpose; and similarly there was with Leonidas Abronichos son of Lysicles  an Athenian  ready to carry news to those at Artemision with a thirty-oared galley  if any disaster should happen to the land-army. This Abronichos then had arrived  and he proceeded to signify to them that which had come to pass about Leonidas and his army; and then when they were informed of it no longer put off their retreat  but set forth in the order in which they were severally posted  the Corinthians first and the Athenians last.,mashup

Themistocles however selected those ships of the Athenians which sailed best  and went round to the springs of drinking-water  cutting inscriptions on the stones there  which the Ionians read when they came to Artemision on the following day. These inscriptions ran thus:Ionians  ye act not rightly in making expedition against the fathers of your race and endeavouring to enslave Hellas. Best of all were it that ye should come and be on our side; but if that may not be done by you  stand aside even now from the combat against us and ask the Carians to do the same as ye.

Themistocles wrote thus  having  as I suppose  two things together in his mind  namely that either the inscriptions might elude the notice of the king and cause the Ionians to change and come over to the side on which he was  or that having been reported and denounced to Xerxes they might cause the Ionians to be distrusted by him  and so he might keep them apart from the sea- fights. Themistocles then had set these inscriptions: and to the Barbarians there came immediately after these things a man of Histaia in a boat bringing word of the retreat of the Hellenes from Artemision. They however  not believing it  kept the messenger under guard and sent swift-sailing ships to look on before. Then these having reported the facts  at last as daylight was spreading over the sky  the whole armament sailed in a body to Artemision; and having stayed at this place till mid-day  after this they sailed to Histaia  and there arrived they took possession of the city of Histaia and overran all the villages which lie along the coast in the region of Ellopia  which is the land of Histaia.,mashup

While they were there  Xerxes  after he had made his dispositions with regard to the bodies of the dead  sent a herald to the fleet: and the dispositions which he made beforehand were as follows:— for all those of his army who were lying dead at Thermopylai  (and there were as many as twenty thousand in all )  with the exception of about a thousand whom he left  he dug trenches and buried them  laying over them leaves and heaping earth upon them  that they might not be seen by the men of the fleet. Then when the herald had gone over to Histaia  he gathered an assembly of the whole force and spoke these words:Allies  king Xerxes grants permission to any one of you who desires it  to leave his post and to come and see how he fights against those most senseless men who looked to overcome the power of the king.,mashup

When the herald had proclaimed this  then boats were of all things most in request  so many were they who desired to see this sight; and when they had passed over they went through the dead bodies and looked at them: and every one supposed that those who were lying there were all Lacedemonians or Thespians  though the Helots also were among those that they saw: however  they who had passed over did not fail to perceive that Xerxes had done that which I mentioned about the bodies of his own dead; for in truth it was a thing to cause laughter even: on the one side there were seen a thousand dead bodies lying  while the others lay all gathered together in the same place  four thousand of them.

There had come also to them a few deserters from Arcadia  men in want of livelihood and desiring to be employed. These the Persians brought into the king's presence and inquired about the Hellenes  what they were doing; and one man it was who asked them this for all the rest. They told them that the Hellenes were keeping the Olympic festival and were looking on at a contest of athletics and horsemanship. He then inquired again  what was the prize proposed to them  for the sake of which they contended; and they told them of the wreath of olive which is given. Then Tigranes the son of Artabanos uttered a thought which was most noble  though thereby he incurred from the king the reproach of cowardice: for hearing that the prize was a wreath and not money  he could not endure to keep silence  but in the presence of all he spoke these words:Ah! Mardonios  what kind of men are these against whom thou hast brought us to fight  who make their contest not for money but for honour! Thus was it spoken by this man.,mashup

In the meantime  so soon as the disaster at Thermopylai had come about  the Thessalians sent a herald forthwith to the Phokians  against whom they had a grudge always  but especially because of the latest disaster which they had suffered: for when both the Thessalians themselves and their allies had invaded the Phokian land not many years before this expedition of the king  they had been defeated by the Phokians and handled by them roughly. For the Phokians had been shut up in Mount Parnassos having with them a soothsayer  Tellias the Eleian; and this Tellias contrived for them a device of the following kind:— he took six hundred men  the best of the Phokians  and whitened them over with chalk  both themselves and their armour  and then he attacked the Thessalians by night  telling the Phokians beforehand to slay every man whom they should see not coloured over with white. So not only the sentinels of the Thessalians  who saw these first  were terrified by them  supposing it to be something portentous and other than it was  but also after the sentinels the main body of their army; so that the Phokians remained in possession of four thousand bodies of slain men and shields; of which last they dedicated half at Abai and half at Delphi; and from the tithe of booty got by this battle were made the large statues which are contending for the tripod in front of the temple at Delphi  and others similar to these are dedicated as an offering at Abai.,mashup

These supposing that they would make short work with the Phokians  riding in full course fell upon the wine-jars; and there the legs of their horses were utterly crippled.,mashup

Bearing then a grudge for both of these things  the Thessalians sent a herald and addressed them thus:Phokians  we advise you to be more disposed now to change your minds and to admit that ye are not on a level with us: for in former times among the Hellenes  so long as it pleased us to be on that side  we always had the preference over you  and now we have such great power with the Barbarian that it rests with us to cause you to be deprived of your land and to be sold into slavery also.

When these words were reported  then the Thessalians  moved with anger against the Phokians  became guides to the Barbarian to show him the way: and from the land of Trachis they entered Doris; for a narrow strip of the Dorian territory extends this way  about thirty furlongs in breadth  lying between Malis and Phokis  the region which was in ancient time called Dryopis; this land is the mother-country of the Dorians in Peloponnese.

When however from Doris they entered Phokis  they did not indeed capture the Phokians themselves; for some of them had gone up to the heights of Parnassos — and that summit of Parnassos is very convenient to receive a large number  which lies by itself near the city of Neon  the name of it being Tithorea — to this  I say  some of them had carried up their goods and gone up themselves; but most of them had conveyed their goods out to the Ozolian Locrians  to the city of Amphissa  which is situated above the Crissaian plain. The Barbarians however overran the whole land of Phokis  for so the Thessalians led their army  and all that they came to as they marched they burned or cut down  and delivered to the flames both the cities and the temples:,mashup

These  I say  of the Barbarians took their way in this direction; but others of them with guides had set forth to go to the temple at Delphi  keeping Parnassos on their right hand: and all the parts of Phokis over which these marched they ravaged; for they set fire to the towns of Panopeus and Daulis and Aiolis. And for this reason they marched in that direction  parted off from the rest of the army  namely in order that they might plunder the temple at Delphi and deliver over the treasures there to king Xerxes: and Xerxes was well acquainted with all that there was in it of any account  better  I am told  than with the things which he had left in his own house at home  seeing that many constantly reported of them  and especially of the votive offerings of Croesus the son of Alyattes.,mashup

Meanwhile the Delphians  having been informed of this  had been brought to extreme fear; and being in great terror they consulted the Oracle about the sacred things  whether they should bury them in the earth or carry them forth to another land; but the god forbade them to meddle with these  saying that he was able by himself to take care of his own. Hearing this they began to take thought for themselves  and they sent their children and women over to Achaia on the other side of the sea  while most of the men themselves ascended up towards the summits of Parnassos and carried their property to the Corykian cave  while others departed for refuge to Amphissa of the Locrians. In short the Delphians had all left the town excepting sixty men and the prophet of the Oracle.,mashup

When the Barbarians had come near and could see the temple  then the prophet  whose name was Akeratos  saw before the cell arms lying laid out  having been brought forth out of the sanctuary  which were sacred and on which it was not permitted to any man to lay hands. He then was going to announce the portent to those of the Delphians who were stil there  but when the Barbarians pressing onwards came opposite the temple of Athene Pronaia  there happened to them in addition portents yet greater than that which had come to pass before: for though that too was a marvel  that arms of war should appear of themselves laid forth outside the cell  yet this  which happened straightway after that  is worthy of marvel even beyond all other prodigies. When the Barbarians in their approach were opposite the temple of Athene Pronaia  at this point of time from the heaven there fell thunderbolts upon them  and from Parnassos two crags were broken away and rushed down upon them with a great crashing noise falling upon many of them  while from the temple of Pronaia there was heard a shout  and a battle-cry was raised.,mashup

Meanwhile the fleet of the Hellenes after leaving Artemision put in to land at Salamis at the request of the Athenians: and for this reason the Athenians requested them to put in to Salamis  namely in order that they might remove out of Attica to a place of safety their children and their wives  and also deliberate what they would have to do; for in their present case they meant to take counsel afresh  because they had been deceived in their expectation. For they had thought to find the Peloponnesians in full force waiting for the Barbarians in Boeotia; they found however nothing of this  but they were informed on the contrary that the Peloponnesians were fortifying the Isthmus with a wall  valuing above all things the safety of the Peloponnese and keeping this in guard; and that they were disposed to let all else go. Being informed of this  the Athenians therefore made request of them to put in to Salamis.,mashup

The others then put in their ships to land at Salamis  but the Athenians went over to their own land; and after their coming they made a proclamation that every one of the Athenians should endeavour to save his children and household as best he could. So the greater number sent them to Troizen  but others to Egina  and others to Salamis  and they were urgent to put these out of danger  both because they desired to obey the oracle and also especially for another reason  which was this:— the Athenians say that a great serpent lives in the temple and guards the Acropolis; and they not only say this  but also they set forth for it monthly offerings  as if it were really there; and the offering consists of a honey-cake. This honey-cake  which before used always to be consumed  was at this time left untouched. When the priestess had signified this  the Athenians left the city much more and with greater eagerness than before  seeing that the goddess also had (as they supposed ) left the Acropolis. Then when all their belongings had been removed out of danger  they sailed to the encampment of the fleet.,mashup

There were assembled accordingly now many more ships than those which were in the sea-fight at Artemision  and from more cities. Over the whole was set as admiral the same man as at Artemision  namely Eurybiades the son of Eurycleides  a Spartan but not of the royal house; the Athenians however supplied by far the greatest number of ships and those which sailed the best.,mashup

So being engaged in saving these  they had been left behind.

While the commanders from the Peloponnese argued thus  an Athenian had come in reporting that the Barbarians were arrived in Attica and that all the land was being laid waste with fire. For the army which directed its march through Boeotia in company with Xerxes  after it had burnt the city of the Thespians (the inhabitants having left it and gone to the Peloponnese ) and that of the Plataians likewise  had now come to Athens and was laying waste everything in those regions. Now he had burnt Thespiai and Plataia because he was informed by the Thebans that these were not taking the side of the Medes.,mashup

So in three months from the crossing of the Hellespont  whence the Barbarians began their march  after having stayed there one month while they crossed over into Europe  they had reached Attica  in the year when Calliades was archon of the Athenians. And they took the lower city  which was deserted  and then they found that there were still a few Athenians left in the temple  either stewards of the temple or needy persons  who had barred the entrance to the Acropolis with doors and with a palisade of timber and endeavoured to defend themselves against the attacks of the enemy  being men who had not gone out to Salamis partly because of their poverty  and also because they thought that they alone had discovered the meaning of the oracle which the Pythian prophetess had uttered to them  namely that thebulwark of wood should be impregnable  and supposed that this was in fact the safe refuge according to the oracle  and not the ships.,mashup

So the Persians taking their post upon the rising ground opposite the Acropolis  which the Athenians call the Hill of Ares  proceeded to besiege them in this fashion  that is they put tow round about their arrows and lighted it  and then shot them against the palisade. The Athenians who were besieged continued to defend themselves nevertheless  although they had come to the extremity of distress and their palisade had played them false; nor would they accept proposals for surrender  when the sons of Peisistratos brought them forward: but endeavouring to defend themselves they contrived several contrivances against the enemy  and among the rest they rolled down large stones when the Barbarians approached the gates; so that for a long time Xerxes was in a difficulty  not being able to capture them.,mashup

In time however there appeared for the Barbarians a way of approach after their difficulties  since by the oracle it was destined that all of Attica which is on the mainland should come to be under the Persians. Thus then it happened that on the front side of the Acropolis behind the gates and the way up to the entrance  in a place where no one was keeping guard  nor would one have supposed that any man could ascend by this way  here men ascended by the temple of Aglauros the daughter of Kecrops  although indeed the place is precipitous: and when the Athenians saw that they had ascended up to the Acropolis  some of them threw themselves down from the wall and perished  while others took refuge in the sanctuary of the temple. Then those of the Persians who had ascended went first to the gates  and after opening these they proceeded to kill the suppliants; and when all had been slain by them  they plundered the temple and set fire to the whole of the Acropolis.,mashup

And on the next day after sending the herald he called together the exiles of the Athenians who were accompanying him  and bade them go up to the Acropolis and sacrifice the victims after their own manner; whether it was that he had seen some vision of a dream which caused him to give this command  or whether perchance he had a scruple in his mind because he had set fire to the temple. The Athenian exiles did accordingly that which was commanded them:,mashup

Now it happened to this olive-tree to be set on fire with the rest of the temple by the Barbarians; and on the next day after the conflagration those of the Athenians who were commanded by the king to offer sacrifice  saw when they had gone up to the temple that a shoot had run up from the stock of the tree about a cubit in length.

The Hellenes meanwhile at Salamis  when it was announced to them how it had been as regards the Acropolis of the Athenians  were disturbed so greatly that some of the commanders did not even wait for the question to be decided which had been proposed  but began to go hastily to their ships and to put up their sails  meaning to make off with speed; and by those of them who remained behind it was finally decided to fight at sea in defence of the Isthmus.

This advice very much commended itself to Themistocles; and without making any answer he went to the ship of Eurybiades. Having come thither he said that he desired to communicate to him a matter which concerned the common good; and Eurybiades bade him come into his ship and speak  if he desired to say anything. Then Themistocles sitting down beside him repeated to him all those things which he had heard Mnesiphilos say  making as if they were his own thoughts  and adding to them many others; until at last by urgent request he persuaded him to come out of his ship and gather the commanders to the council.,mashup

For hear both ways  and then set them in comparison. If thou engage battle at the Isthmus  thou wilt fight in an open sea  into which it is by no means convenient for us that we go to fight  seeing that we have ships which are heavier and fewer in number than those of the enemy. Then secondly thou wilt give up to destruction Salamis and Megara and Egina  even if we have success in all else; for with their fleet will come also the land-army  and thus thou wilt thyself lead them to the Peloponnese and wilt risk the safety of all Hellas.,mashup

This objection he made against him because Athens had been taken and was held by the enemy. Then Themistocles said many evil things of him and of the Corinthians both  and declared also that he himself and his countrymen had in truth a city and a land larger than that of the Corinthians  so long as they had two hundred ships fully manned; for none of the Hellenes would be able to repel the Athenians if they came to fight against them.,mashup

Nay  but do as I advise. If  however  thou shalt not do so  we shall forthwith take up our households and voyage to Siris in Italy  which is ours already of old and the oracles say that it is destined to be colonised by us; and ye  when ye are left alone and deprived of allies such as we are  will remember my words.,mashup

And as they had determined  so also they did; for when they had prayed to all the gods  they called Ajax and Telamon to their help from Salamis  where the fleet was  and sent a ship to Egina to bring Aiacos himself and the rest of the sons of Aiacos.,mashup

Moreover Dicaios the son of Theokydes  an Athenian  who was an exile and had become of great repute among the Medes at this time  declared that when the Attic land was being ravaged by the land-army of Xerxes  having been deserted by the Athenians  he happened then to be in company with Demaratos the Lacedemonian in the Thriasian plain; and he saw a cloud of dust going up from Eleusis  as if made by a company of about thirty thousand men  and they wondered at the cloud of dust  by what men it was caused. Then forthwith they heard a sound of voices  and Dicaios perceived that the sound was the mystic cry  Iacchos; but Demaratos  having no knowledge of the sacred rites which are done at Eleusis  asked him what this was that uttered the sound  and he said:Demaratos  it cannot be but that some great destruction is about to come to the army of the king: for as to this  it is very manifest  seeing that Attica is deserted  that this which utters the sound is of the gods  and that it is going from Eleusis to help the Athenians and their allies: if then it shall come down in the Peloponnese  there is danger for the king himself and for the army which is upon the mainland  but if it shall direct its course towards the ships which are at Salamis  the king will be in danger of losing his fleet. This feast the Athenians celebrate every year to the Mother and the Daughter; and he that desires it  both of them and of the other Hellenes  is initiated in the mysteries; and the sound of voices which thou hearest is the cry  Iacchos  which they utter at this feast. To this Demaratos said:Keep silence and tell not this tale to any other man; for if these words of thine be reported to the king  thou wilt surely lose thy head  and neither I nor any other man upon earth will be able to save thee: but keep thou quiet  and about this expedition the gods will provide. He then thus advised  and after the cloud of dust and the sound of voices there came a mist which was borne aloft and carried towards Salamis to the camp of the Hellenes: and thus they learnt (said he ) that the fleet of Xerxes was destined to be destroyed. Such was the report made by Dicaios the son of Theodykes  appealing to Demaratos and others also as witnesses.,mashup

And  as I suppose  they made their attack upon Athens not fewer in number both by land and sea than when they had arrived at Sepias and at Thermopylai: for against those of them who perished by reason of the storm and those who were slain at Thermopylai and in the sea-fights at Artemision  I will set those who at that time were not yet accompanying the king  the Malians  Dorians  Locrians  and Boeotians (who accompanied him in a body  except the Thespians and Plataians )  and moreover those of Carystos  Andros  and Tenos  with all the other islanders except the five cities of which I mentioned the names before; for the more the Persian advanced towards the centre of Hellas  the more nations accompanied him.,mashup

Tell the king I pray thee  Mardonios  that I  who have proved myself not to be the worst in the sea-fights which have been fought near Euboea  and have displayed deeds not inferior to those of others  speak to him thus: Master  it is right that I set forth the opinion which I really have  and say that which I happen to think best for thy cause: and this I say — spare thy ships and do not make a sea-fight; for the men are as much stronger than thy men by sea  as men are stronger than women. And why must thou needs run the risk of sea-battles? Hast thou not Athens in thy possession  for the sake of which thou didst set forth on thy march  and also the rest of Hellas? and no man stands in thy way to resist  but those who did stand against thee came off as it was fitting that they should.,mashup

If thou do not hasten to make a sea-fight  but keep thy ships here by the land  either remaining here thyself or even advancing on to the Peloponnese  that which thou hast come to do  O master  will easily be effected; for the Hellenes are not able to hold out against thee for any long time  but thou wilt soon disperse them and they will take flight to their several cities: since neither have they provisions with them in this island  as I am informed  nor is it probable that if thou shalt march thy land-army against the Peloponnese  they who have come from thence will remain still; for these will have no care to fight a battle in defence of Athens.,mashup

When however the opinions were reported to Xerxes  he was greatly pleased with the opinion of Artemisia; and whereas even before this he thought her excellent  he commended her now yet more. Nevertheless he gave orders to follow the advice of the greater number  thinking that when they fought by Euboea they were purposely slack  because he was not himself present with them  whereas now he had made himself ready to look on while they fought a sea-battle.,mashup

So when they passed the word to put out to sea  they brought their ships out to Salamis and quietly ranged themselves along the shore in their several positions. At that time the daylight was not sufficient for them to engage battle  for night had come on; but they made their preparations to fight on the following day. Meanwhile the Hellenes were possessed by fear and dismay  especially those who were from Peloponnese: and these were dismayed because remaining in Salamis they were to fight a battle on behalf of the land of the Athenians  and being defeated they would be cut off from escape and blockaded in an island  leaving their own land unguarded. And indeed the land-army of the Barbarians was marching forward during that very night towards the Peloponnese.,mashup

Yet every means had been taken that the Barbarians might not be able to enter Peloponnesus by land: for as soon as the Peloponnesians heard that Leonidas and his company had perished at Thermopylai  they came together quickly from the cities and took post at the Isthmus  and over them was set as commander Cleombrotos  the son of Anaxandrides and brother of Leonidas. These being posted at the Isthmus had destroyed the Skironian way  and after this (having so determined in counsel with one another ) they began to build a wall across the Isthmus; and as they were many myriads and every man joined in the work  the work proceeded fast; for stones and bricks and pieces of timber and baskets full of sand were carried to it continually  and they who had thus come to help paused not at all in their work either by night or by day.,mashup

Now Peloponnesus is inhabited by seven races; and of these  two are natives of the soil and are settled now in the place where they dwelt of old  namely the Arcadians and the Kynurians; and one race  that of the Achaians  though it did not remove from the Peloponnese  yet removed in former time from its own land and dwells now in that which was not its own. The remaining races  four in number  have come in from without  namely the Dorians  Aitolians  Dryopians and Lemnians. Of the Dorians there are many cities and of great renown; of the Aitolians  Elis alone; of the Dryopians  Hermion and Asine  which latter is opposite Cardamyle in the Laconian land; and of the Lemnians  all the Paroreatai. The Kynurians  who are natives of the soil  seem alone to be Ionians  but they have become Dorians completely because they are subject to the Argives and by lapse of time  being originally citizens of Orneai or the dwellers in the country round Orneai. Of these seven nations the remaining cities  except those which I enumerated just now  stood aside and did nothing; and if one may be allowed to speak freely  in thus standing aside they were in fact taking the side of the Medes.,mashup

For some time then they spoke of it in private  one man standing by another  and they marvelled at the ill-counsel of Eurybiades; but at last it broke out publicly. A meeting accordingly was held  and much was spoken about the same points as before  some saying that they ought to sail away to Peloponnesus and run the risk in defence of that  and not stay and fight for a land which had been captured by the enemy  while the Athenians  Eginetans and Megarians urged that they should stay there and defend themselves.,mashup

Then Themistocles  when his opinion was like to be defeated by the Peloponnesians  secretly went forth from the assembly  and having gone out he sent a man to the encampment of the Medes in a boat  charging him with that which he must say: this man's name was Sikinnos  and he was a servant of Themistocles and tutor to his children; and after these events Themistocles entered him as a Thespian citizen  when the Thespians were admitting new citizens  and made him a wealthy man. He at this time came with a boat and said to the commanders of the Barbarians these words:The commander of the Athenians sent me privately without the knowledge of the other Hellenes (for  as it chances  he is disposed to the cause of the king  and desires rather that your side should gain the victory than that of the Hellenes )  to inform you that the Hellenes are planning to take flight  having been struck with dismay; and now it is possible for you to execute a most noble work  if ye do not permit them to flee away: for they are not of one mind with one another and they will not stand against you in fight  but ye shall see them fighting a battle by sea with one another  those who are disposed to your side against those who are not.,mashup

And for this reason they put out their ships  namely in order that the Hellenes might not even be permitted to get away  but being cut off in Salamis might pay the penalty for the contests at Artemision: and they disembarked men of the Persians on the small island called Psyttaleia for this reason  namely that when the fight should take place  these might save the men of one side and destroy those of the other  since there especially it was likely that the men and the wrecks of ships would be cast up on shore  for the island lay in the way of the sea-fight which was to be. These things they did in silence  that the enemy might not have information of them.,mashup

Then while the commanders were engaged in strife  there came over from Egina Aristeides the son of Lysimachos  an Athenian who had been ostracised by the people  a man whom I hold (according to that which I hear of his character ) to have been the best and most upright of all Athenians. This man came into the council and called forth Themistocles  who was to him not a friend  but an enemy to the last degree; but because of the greatness of the present troubles he let those matters be forgotten and called him forth  desiring to communicate with him. Now he had heard beforehand that the Peloponnesians were pressing to take the ships away to the Isthmus. So when Themistocles came forth to him  Aristeides spoke these words:Both at other times when occasion arises  and also especially at this time we ought to carry on rivalry as to which of us shall do more service to our country. And I tell thee now that it is indifferent whether the Peloponnesians say many words or few about sailing away from hence; for having been myself an eye-witness I tell thee that now not even if the Corinthians and Eurybiades himself desire to sail out  will they be able; for we are encompassed round by the enemy.

He made answer as follows:Thou advisest very well  and also the news which thou hast brought is good  since thou art come having witnessed with thine own eyes that which I desired might come to pass: for know that this which is being done by the Medes is of my suggestion; because  when the Hellenes would not come to a battle of their own will  it was necessary to bring them over to us against their will. Do thou however  since thou art come bearing good news  thyself report it to them; for if I say these things  I shall be thought to speak that which I have myself invented  and I shall not persuade them  but they will think that the Barbarians are not doing so.

The Hellenes then  since they believed that which was said by the Tenians  were preparing for a sea-fight: and as the dawn appeared  they made an assembly of those who fought on board the ships and addressed them  Themistocles making a speech which was eloquent beyond the rest; and the substance of it was to set forth all that is better as opposed to that which is worse  of the several things which arise in the nature and constitution of man; and having exhorted them to choose the better  and thus having wound up his speech  he bade them embark in their ships.

The Athenians say that the beginning of the battle was made thus  but the Eginetans say that the ship which went away to Egina to bring the sons of Aiacos was that which began the fight.

As regards the rest I cannot speak of them separately  or say precisely how the Barbarians or the Hellenes individually contended in the fight; but with regard to Artemisia that which happened was this  whence she gained yet more esteem than before from the king.— When the affairs of the king had come to great confusion  at this crisis a ship of Artemisia was being pursued by an Athenian ship; and as she was not able to escape  for in front of her were other ships of her own side  while her ship  as it chanced  was furthest advanced towards the enemy  she resolved what she would do  and it proved also much to her advantage to have done so. While she was being pursued by the Athenian ship she charged with full career against a ship of her own side manned by Calyndians and in which the king of the Calyndians Damasithymos was embarked. Now  even though it be true that she had had some strife with him before  while they were still about the Hellespont  yet I am not able to say whether she did this by intention  or whether the Calyndian ship happened by chance to fall in her way. Having charged against it however and sunk it  she enjoyed good fortune and got for herself good in two ways; for first the captain of the Athenian ship  when he saw her charge against a ship manned by Barbarians  turned away and went after others  supposing that the ship of Artemisia was either a Hellenic ship or was deserting from the Barbarians and fighting for the Hellenes ,mashup

For it is said that the king looking on at the fight perceived that her ship had charged the other; and one of those present said:Master  dost thou see Artemisia  how well she is fighting  and how she sank even now a ship of the enemy ? He asked whether this was in truth the deed of Artemisia  and they said that it was; for (they declared ) they knew very well the sign of her ship: and that which was destroyed they thought surely was one of the enemy; for besides other things which happened fortunately for her  as I have said  there was this also  namely that not one of the crew of the Calyndian ship survived to become her accuser. And Xerxes in answer to that which was said to him is reported to have uttered these words:My men have become women  and my women men. Thus it is said that Xerxes spoke.,mashup

It happened also in the course of this confusion that some of the Phenicians  whose ships had been destroyed  came to the king and accused the Ionians  saying that by means of them their ships had been lost  and that they had been traitors to the cause. Now it so came about that not only the commanders of the Ionians did not lose their lives  but the Phenicians who accused them received a reward such as I shall tell. While these men were yet speaking thus  a Samothrakian ship charged against an Athenian ship: and as the Athenian ship was being sunk by it  an Eginetan ship came up against the Samothrakian vessel and ran it down. Then the Samothrakians  being skilful javelin- throwers  by hurling cleared off the fighting-men from the ship which had wrecked theirs and then embarked upon it and took possession of it. This event saved the Ionians from punishment; for when Xerxes saw that they had performed a great exploit  he turned to the Phenicians (for he was exceedingly vexed and disposed to find fault with all ) and bade cut off their heads  in order that they might not  after having been cowards themselves  accuse others who were better men than they. For whensoever Xerxes (sitting just under the mountain opposite Salamis  which is called Aigaleos ) saw any one of his own side display a deed of valour in the sea-fight  he inquired about him who had done it  and the scribes recorded the name of the ship's captain with that of his father and the city from whence he came. Moreover also Ariaramnes  a Persian who was present  shared the fate of the Phenicians  being their friend. They then proceeded to deal with the Phenicians.,mashup

In the meantime  as the Barbarians turned to flight and were sailing out towards Phaleron  the Eginetans waited for them in the passage and displayed memorable actions: for while the Athenians in the confused tumult were disabling both those ships which resisted and those which were fleeing  the Eginetans were destroying those which attempted to sail away; and whenever any escaped the Athenians  they went in full course and fell among the Eginetans.,mashup

Then there met one another the ship of Themistocles  which was pursuing a ship of the enemy  and that of Polycritos the son of Crios the Eginetan. This last had charged against a ship of Sidon  the same that had taken the Eginetan vessel which was keeping watch in advance at Skiathos  and in which sailed Pytheas the son of Ischeno�s  whom the Persians kept in their ship  all cut to pieces as he was  making a marvel of his valour. The Sidonian ship then was captured bearing with it this man as well as the Persians of whom I spoke  so that Pytheas thus came safe to Egina. Now when Polycritos looked at the Athenian vessel he recognised when he saw it the sign of the admiral's ship  and shouting out he addressed Themistocles with mockery about the accusation brought against the Eginetans of taking the side of the Medes  and reproached him. This taunt Polycritos threw out against Themistocles after he had charged against the ship of Sidon. And meanwhile those Barbarians whose ships had escaped destruction fled and came to Phaleron to be under cover of the land-army.,mashup

Now if he had known that Artemisia was sailing in this ship  he would not have ceased until either he had taken her or had been taken himself; for orders had been given to the Athenian captains  and moreover a prize was offered of ten thousand drachmas for the man who should take her alive; since they thought it intolerable that a woman should make an expedition against Athens. She then  as has been said before  had made her escape; and the others also  whose ships had escaped destruction  were at Phaleron.,mashup

As regards Adeimantos the commander of the Corinthians  the Athenians say that forthwith at the beginning when the ships were engaging in the fight  being struck with panic and terror he put up his sails and fled away; and the Corinthians  when they saw the admiral's ship fleeing  departed likewise: and after this  as the story goes  when they came in their flight opposite to the temple of Athene Skiras in the land of Salamis  there fell in with them by divine guidance a light vessel  which no one was ever found to have sent  and which approached the Corinthians at a time when they knew nothing of that which was happening with the fleet. And by this it is conjectured that the matter was of the Deity; for when they came near to the ships  the men in the light vessel said these words:Adeimantos  thou hast turned thy ships away and hast set forth to flee  deserting the cause of the Hellenes  while they are in truth gaining a victory and getting the better of their foes as much as they desired. When they said this  since Adeimantos doubted of it  they spoke a second time and said that they might be taken as hostages and slain  if the Hellenes should prove not to be gaining the victory. Then he turned his ship back  he and the others with him  and they reached the camp when the work was finished. Such is the report spread by the Athenians against these: the Corinthians however do not allow this to be so  but hold that they were among the first in the sea- fight; and the rest of Hellas also bears witness on their side.,mashup

When Xerxes perceived the disaster which had come upon him  he feared lest some one of the Ionians should suggest to the Hellenes  or they should themselves form the idea  to sail to the Hellespont and break up the bridges; and so he might be cut off in Europe and run the risk of perishing utterly: therefore he began to consider about taking flight. He desired however that his intention should not be perceived either by the Hellenes or by those of his own side; therefore he attempted to construct a mole going across to Salamis  and he bound together Phenician merchant vessels in order that they might serve him both for a bridge and a wall  and made preparations for fighting as if he were going to have another battle by sea. Seeing him do so  all the rest made sure that he had got himself ready in earnest and intended to stay and fight; but Mardonios did not fail to perceive the true meaning of all these things  being by experience very well versed in his way of thinking.,mashup

While Xerxes was doing thus  he sent a messenger to the Persians  to announce the calamity which had come upon them. Now there is nothing mortal which accomplishes a journey with more speed than these messengers  so skilfully has this been invented by the Persians: for they say that according to the number of days of which the entire journey consists  so many horses and men are set at intervals  each man and horse appointed for a day's journey. These neither snow nor rain nor heat nor darkness of night prevents from accomplishing each one the task proposed to him  with the very utmost speed. The first then rides and delivers the message with which he is charged to the second  and the second to the third; and after that it goes through them handed from one to the other  as in the torch-race among the Hellenes  which they perform for Hephaistos. This kind of running of their horses the Persians call  angareion.,mashup

As regards the Persians this went on for all the time which intervened  until the coming of Xerxes himself caused them to cease: and Mardonios seeing that Xerxes was greatly troubled by reason of the sea-fight  and suspecting that he was meaning to take flight from Athens  considered with regard to himself that he would have to suffer punishment for having persuaded the king to make an expedition against Hellas  and that it was better for him to run the risk of either subduing Hellas or ending his own life honourably  placing his safety in suspense for a great end  though his opinion was rather that he would subdue Hellas;— he reckoned up these things  I say  and addressed his speech to the king as follows:Master  be not thou grieved  nor feel great trouble on account of this thing which has come to pass; for it is not upon a contest of timbers that all our fortunes depend  but of men and of horses: and none of these who suppose now that all has been achieved by them will attempt to disembark from the ships and stand against thee  nor will any in this mainland do so; but those who did stand against us paid the penalty. If therefore thou thinkest this good to do  let us forthwith attempt the Peloponnese  or if thou thinkest good to hold back  we may do that. Do not despond however  for there is no way of escape for the Hellenes to avoid being thy slaves  after they have first given an account of that which they did to thee both now and at former times. Thus it were best to do; but if thou hast indeed resolved to retire thyself and to withdraw thy army  I have another counsel to offer for that case too. Do not thou  O king  let the Persians be an object of laughter to the Hellenes; for none of thy affairs have suffered by means of the Persians  nor wilt thou be able to mention any place where we proved ourselves cowards: but if Phenicians or Egyptians or Cyprians or Kilikians proved themselves cowards  the calamity which followed does not belong to the Persians in any way. Now therefore  since it is not the Persians who are guilty towards thee  follow my counsel. If thou hast determined not to remain here  retire thou to thine own abode  taking with thee the main body of the army  and it must then be for me to deliver over to thee Hellas reduced to subjection  choosing for this purpose thirty myriads from the army.,mashup

Hearing this Xerxes was rejoiced and delighted so far as he might be after his misfortunes  and to Mardonios he said that when he had taken counsel he would reply and say which of these two things he would do. So when he was taking counsel with those of the Persians who were called to be his advisers  it seemed good to him to send for Artemisia also to give him counsel  because at the former time she alone had showed herself to have perception of that which ought to be done. So when Artemisia had come  Xerxes removed from him all the rest  both the Persian councillors and also the spearmen of the guard and spoke to her thus:Mardonios bids me stay here and make an attempt on the Peloponnese  saying that the Persians and the land- army are not guilty of any share in my calamity  and that they would gladly give me proof of this. He bids me therefore either do this or  if not  he desires himself to choose thirty myriads from the army and to deliver over to me Hellas reduced to subjection; and he bids me withdraw with the rest of the army to my own abode. Do thou therefore  as thou didst well advise about the sea-fight which was fought  urging that we should not bring it on  so also now advise me which of these things I shall do  that I may succeed in determining well.,mashup

He thus consulted her  and she spoke these words:O king  it is hard for me to succeed in saying the best things when one asks me for counsel; yet it seems good to me at the present that thou shouldest retire back and leave Mardonios here  if he desires it and undertakes to do this  together with those whom he desires to have: for on the one hand if he subdue those whom he says that he desires to subdue  and if those matters succeed well which he has in mind when he thus speaks  the deed will after all be thine  master  seeing that thy slaves achieved it: and on the other hand if the opposite shall come to pass of that which Mardonios intends  it will be no great misfortune  seeing that thou wilt thyself remain safe  and also the power in those parts which concerns thy house: for if thou shalt remain safe with thy house  many contests many times over repeated will the Hellenes have to pass through for their own existence. Of Mardonios however  if he suffer any disaster  no account will be made; and if the Hellenes conquer they gain a victory which is no victory  having destroyed one who is but thy slave. Thou however wilt retire having done that for which thou didst make thy march  that is to say  having delivered Athens to the fire.,mashup

He commended Artemisia therefore and sent her away to conduct his sons to Ephesos  for there were certain bastard sons of his which accompanied him.,mashup

Of these Pedasians was Hermotimos.] And this man of all persons whom we know up to this time obtained the greatest revenge for a wrong done to him. For he had been captured by enemies and was being sold  and Panionios a man of Chios bought him  one who had set himself to gain his livelihood by the most impious practices; for whenever he obtained boys who possessed some beauty  he would make eunuchs of them  and then taking them to Sardis or Ephesos sold them for large sums of money  since with the Barbarians eunuchs are held to be of more value for all matters of trust than those who are not eunuchs. Panionios then  I say  made eunuchs of many others  since by this he got his livelihood  and also of this man about whom I speak: and Hermotimos  being not in everything unfortunate  was sent from Sardis to the king with other gifts  and as time went on he came to be honoured more than all the other eunuchs in the sight of Xerxes.,mashup

Then  when he had caught him together with his whole house  Hermotimos spoke as follows:O thou  who of all men that ever lived up to this time didst gain thy substance by the most impious deeds  what evil did either I myself or any of my forefathers do either to thee or to any of thine  that thou didst make me to be that which is nought instead of a man? Didst thou suppose that thou wouldest escape the notice of the gods for such things as then thou didst devise? They however following the rule of justice delivered thee into my hands  since thou hadst done impious deeds; so that thou shalt not have reason to find fault with the penalty which shall be inflicted upon thee by me. When he had thus reproached him  the man's sons were brought into his presence and Panionios was compelled to make eunuchs of his own sons  who were four in number  and being compelled he did so; and then when he had so done  the sons were compelled to do the same thing to him. Thus vengeance by the hands of Hermotimos overtook Panionios.,mashup

When Xerxes had entrusted his sons to Artemisia to carry them back to Ephesos  he called Mardonios and bade him choose of the army whom he would  and make his deeds  if possible  correspond to his words. During this day then things went so far; and in the night on the command of the king the leaders of the fleet began to withdraw their ships from Phaleron to the Hellespont  as quickly as they might each one  to guard the bridges for the king to pass over. And when the Barbarians were near Zoster as they sailed  then seeing the small points of rock which stretch out to sea from this part of the mainland  they thought that these were ships and fled for a good distance. In time however  perceiving that they were not ships but points of rock  they assembled together again and continued on their voyage.,mashup

When day dawned  the Hellenes  seeing that the land-army was staying still in its place  supposed that the ships also were about Phaleron; and thinking that they would fight another sea-battle  they made preparations to repel them. When however they were informed that the ships had departed  forthwith upon this they thought it good to pursue after them. They pursued therefore as far as Andros  but did not get a sight of the fleet of Xerxes; and when they had come to Andros  they deliberated what they should do. Themistocles then declared as his opinion that they should take their course through the islands and pursue after the ships  and afterwards sail straight to the Hellespont to break up the bridges; but Eurybiades expressed the opposite opinion to this  saying that if they should break up the floating-bridges  they would therein do the greatest possible evil to Hellas: for if the Persian should be cut off and compelled to remain in Europe  he would endeavour not to remain still  since if he remained still  neither could any of his affairs go forward  nor would any way of returning home appear; but his army would perish of hunger: whereas if he made the attempt and persevered in it  all Europe might be brought over to him  city by city and nation by nation  the inhabitants being either conquered or surrendering on terms before they were conquered: moreover they would have for food the crops of the Hellenes which grew year by year. He thought however that conquered in the sea-fight the Persian would not stay in Europe  and therefore he might be allowed to flee until in his flight he came to his own land. Then after that they might begin the contest for the land which belonged to the Persian. To this opinion the commanders of the other Peloponnesians adhered also.,mashup

When Themistocles perceived that he would not be able to persuade them  or at least the greater number of them  to sail to the Hellespont  he changed his counsel and turning to the Athenians (for these were grieved most at the escape of the enemy and were anxious to sail to the Hellespont even by themselves alone  if the others were not willing ) to them he spoke as follows:I myself also have been present before now on many occasions  and have heard of many more  on which something of this kind came to pass  namely that men who were forced into great straits  after they had been defeated fought again and repaired their former disaster: and as for us  since we have won as a prize from fortune the existence of ourselves and of Hellas by repelling from our land so great a cloud of men  let us not pursue enemies who flee from us: for of these things not we were the doors  but the gods and heroes  who grudged that one man should become king of both Asia and of Europe  and he a man unholy and presumptuous  one who made no difference between things sacred and things profane  burning and casting down the images of the gods  and who also scourged the Sea and let down into it fetters. But as things are at present  it is well that we should now remain in Hellas and look after ourselves and our households; and let each man repair his house  and have a care for sowing his land  after he has completely driven away the Barbarian: and then at the beginning of the spring let us sail down towards the Hellespont and Ionia. Thus he spoke  intending to lay up for himself a store of gratitude with the Persian  in order that if after all any evil should come upon him at the hands of the Athenians  he might have a place of refuge: and this was in fact that which came to pass.,mashup

Themistocles then speaking thus endeavoured to deceive them  and the Athenians followed his advice: for he had had the reputation even in former times of being a man of ability and he had now proved himself to be in truth both able and of good judgment; therefore they were ready in every way to follow his advice when he spoke. So when these had been persuaded by him  forthwith after this Themistocles sent men with a vessel  whom he trusted to keep silence  to whatever test they might be brought  of that which he himself charged them to tell the king; and of them Sikinnos his servant again was one. When these came to Attica  the rest stayed behind in the ship  while Sikinnos went up to Xerxes and spoke these words:Themistocles the son of Neocles sent me  who is commander of the Athenians  and of all the allies the best and ablest man  to tell thee that Themistocles the Athenian  desiring to be of service to thee  held back the Hellenes when they were desirous to pursue after thy ships and to destroy the bridges on the Hellespont.

The Hellenes meanwhile  having resolved not to pursue after the ships of the Barbarians further  nor to sail to the Hellespont to break up the passage  were investing Andros intending to take it: for the Andrians were the first of the islanders who  being asked by Themistocles for money  refused to give it: and when Themistocles made proposals to them and said that the Athenians had come having on their side two great deities  Persuasion and Compulsion  and therefore they must by all means give them money  they replied to this that not without reason  as it now appeared  was Athens great and prosperous  since the Athenians were well supplied with serviceable deities; but as for the Andrians  they were poor  having in this respect attained to the greatest eminence  and there were two unprofitable deities which never left their island but always remained attached to the place  Poverty  namely  and Helplessness: and the Andrians being possessed of these deities would not give money; for never could the power of the Athenians get the better of their inability.,mashup

Thus saying he collected great sums of money from the Carystians and the Parians  who being informed how Andros was being besieged  because it had taken the side of the Medes  and how Themistocles was held in more regard than any of the other commanders  sent money for fear of this. Whether any others of the islanders also gave money I am not able to say  but I think that some others gave and not these alone. Yet to the Carystians at least there was no respite from the evil on this account  but the Parians escaped the attack  because they propitiated Themistocles with money. Thus Themistocles with Andros as his starting-point was acquiring sums of money for himself from the men of the islands without the knowledge of the other commanders.,mashup

Xerxes meanwhile with his army stayed for a few days after the sea-fight  and then they all began to march forth towards Boeotia by the same way by which they had come: for Mardonios thought both that it was well for him to escort the king on his way  and also that it was now too late in the year to carry on the war; it was better  he thought  to winter in Thessaly and then at the beginning of spring to attempt the Peloponnese. When he came to Thessaly  then Mardonios chose out for himself first all those Persians who are calledImmortals  except only their commander Hydarnes (for Hydarnes said that he would not be left behind by the king )  and after them of the other Persians those who wore cuirasses  and the body of a thousand horse: also the Medes  Sacans  Bactrians and Indians  foot and horsemen both. These nations he chose in the mass  but from the other allies he selected by few at a time  choosing whose who had fine appearance of those of whom he knew that they had done good service. From the Persians he chose more than from any other single nation  and these wore collars of twisted metal and bracelets; and after them came the Medes  who in fact were not inferior in number to the Persians  but only in bodily strength. The result was that there were thirty myriads in all  including cavalry.,mashup

During this time  while Mardonios was selecting his army and Xerxes was in Thessaly  there had come an oracle from Delphi to the Lacedemonians  bidding them ask satisfaction from Xerxes for the murder of Leonidas and accept that which should be given by him. The Spartans therefore sent a herald as quickly as possible  who having found the whole army still in Thessaly came into the presence of Xerxes and spoke these words:O king of the Medes  the Lacedemonians and the sons of Heracles of Sparta demand of thee satisfaction for murder  because thou didst kill their king  fighting in defence of Hellas. He laughed and then kept silence some time  and after that pointing to Mardonios  who happened to be standing by him  he said:Then Mardonios here shall give them satisfaction  such as is fitting for them to have.,mashup

The herald accordingly accepted the utterance and departed; and Xerxes leaving Mardonios in Thessaly went on himself in haste to the Hellespont and arrived at the passage where the crossing was in five-and-thirty days  bringing back next to nothing  as one may say  of his army: and whithersoever they came on the march and to whatever nation  they seized the crops of that people and used them for provisions; and if they found no crops  then they took the grass which was growing up from the earth  and stripped off the bark from the trees and plucked down the leaves and devoured them  alike of the cultivated trees and of those growing wild; and they left nothing behind them: thus they did by reason of famine. Then plague too seized upon the army and dysentery  which destroyed them by the way  and some of them also who were sick the king left behind  laying charge upon the cities where at the time he chanced to be in his march  to take care of them and support them: of these he left some in Thessaly  and some at Siris in Paionia  and some in Macedonia. In these parts too he had left behind him the sacred chariot of Zeus  when he was marching against Hellas; but on his return he did not receive it back: for the Paionians had given it to the Thracians  and when Xerxes asked for it again  they said that the mares while at pasture had been carried off by the Thracians of the upper country  who dwelt about the source of the Strymon.,mashup

While staying there for a time they had distributed to them an allowance of food more abundant than they had had by the way  and from satisfying their hunger without restraint and also from the changes of water there died many of those in the army who had remained safe till then.

There is also another story reported as follows  namely that when Xerxes on his march away from Athens came to Eion on the Strymon  from that point he did not continue further to make marches by road  but delivered his army to Hydarnes to lead back to the Hellespont  while he himself embarked in a Phenician ship and set forth for Asia; and as he sailed he was seized by a wind from the Strymon  violent and raising great waves; and since he was tossed by the storm more and more  the ship being heavily laden (for there were upon the deck great numbers of Persians  those namely who went with Xerxes )  the king upon that falling into fear shouted aloud and asked the pilot whether there were for them any means of safety. He said:Master  there are none  unless some way be found of freeing ourselves of the excessive number of passengers. Then it is said that Xerxes  when he heard this  spoke thus:Persians  now let each one of you show that he has care for the king; for my safety  as it seems  depends upon you. He  they say  thus spoke  and they made obeisance to him and leapt out into the sea; and so the ship being lightened came safe to Asia. As soon as they had landed Xerxes  they say  first presented the pilot with a wreath of gold  because he had saved the life of the king  and then cut off his head  because he had caused the death of many of the Persians.,mashup

This other story  I say  is reported about the return of Xerxes  but I for my part can by no means believe it  either in other respects or as regards this which is said to have happened to the Persians; for if this which I have related had in truth been said by the pilot to Xerxes  not one person's opinion in ten thousand will differ from mine that the king would have done some such thing as this  that is to say  he would have caused those who were upon the deck to go down below into the hold  seeing that they were Persians of the highest rank among the Persians; and of the rowers  who were Phenicians  he would have thrown out into the sea a number equal to the number of those.

Then when the Hellenes had sent first-fruits to Delphi  they asked the god on behalf of all whether the first-fruits which he had received were fully sufficient and acceptable to him. He said that from the Hellenes he had received enough  but not from the Eginetans  and from them he demanded the offering of their prize of valour for the sea- fight at Salamis. Hearing this the Eginetans dedicated golden stars  three in number  upon a ship's mast of bronze  which are placed in the corner close to the mixing-bowl of Croesus.,mashup

As a prize of valour they gave to Eurybiades a wreath of olive; and for ability and skill they gave to Themistocles also a wreath of olive  and presented him besides with the chariot which was judged to be the best in Sparta. So having much commended him  they escorted him on his departure with three hundred picked men of the Spartans  the same who are called thehorsemen  as far as the boundaries of Tegea: and he is the only man of all we know to whom the Spartans ever gave escort on his way.,mashup

Artabazos meanwhile the son of Pharnakes  a man who was held in esteem among the Persians even before this and came to be so yet more after the events about Plataia  was escorting the king as far as the passage with six myriads of that army which Mardonios had selected for himself; and when the king was in Asia and Artabazos on his march back came near to Pallene  finding that Mardonios was wintering in Thessaly and Macedonia and was not at present urgent with him to come and join the rest of the army  he thought it not good to pass by without reducing the Potidaians to slavery  whom he had found in revolt: for the men of Potidaia  when the king had marched by them and when the fleet of the Persians had departed in flight from Salamis  had openly made revolt from the Barbarians; and so also had the others done who occupy Pallene.,mashup

So upon this Artabazos began to besiege Potidaia  and suspecting that the men of Olynthos also were intending revolt from the king  he began to besiege this city too  which was occupied by Bottiaians who had been driven away from the Thermaian gulf by the Macedonians. So when he had taken these men by siege  he brought them forth to a lake and slew them there; and the city he delivered to Critobulos of Torone to have in charge  and to the natives of Chalkidike; and thus it was that the Chalkidians got possession of Olynthos.,mashup

Having taken this city Artabazos set himself to attack Potidaia with vigour  and as he was setting himself earnestly to this work  Timoxeinos the commander of the troops from Skione concerted with him to give up the town by treachery. Now in what manner he did this at the first  I for my part am not able to say  for this is not reported; at last however it happened as follows. Whenever either Timoxeinos wrote a paper wishing to send it to Artabazos  or Artabazos wishing to send one to Timoxeinos  they wound it round by the finger-notches of an arrow  and then  putting feathers over the paper  they shot it to a place agreed upon between them. It came however to be found out that Timoxeinos was attempting by treachery to give up Potidaia; for Artabazos  shooting an arrow at the place agreed upon  missed this spot and struck a man of Potidaia in the shoulder; and when he was struck  a crowd came about him  as is apt to happen when there is fighting  and they forthwith took the arrow and having discovered the paper carried it to the commanders. Now there was present an allied force of the other men of Pallene also. Then when the commanders had read the paper and discovered who was guilty of the treachery  they resolved not openly to convict Timoxeinos of treachery  for the sake of the city of Skione  lest the men of Skione should be esteemed traitors for all time to come.,mashup

He then in such a manner as this had been discovered; and when three months had gone by while Artabazos was besieging the town  there came to be a great ebb of the sea backwards  which lasted for a long time; and the Barbarians  seeing that shallow water had been produced  endeavoured to get by into the peninsula of Pallene  but when they had passed through two fifth-parts of the distance  and yet three- fifths remained  which they must pass through before they were within Pallene  then there came upon them a great flood-tide of the sea  higher than ever before  as the natives of the place say  though high tides come often. So those of them who could not swim perished  and those who could were slain by the men of Potidaia who put out to them in boats. The cause of the high tide and flood and of that which befell the Persians was this  as the Potidaians say  namely that these same Persians who perished by means of the sea had committed impiety towards the temple of Poseidon and his image in the suburb of their town; and in saying that this was the cause  in my opinion they say well. The survivors of his army Artabazos led away to Thessaly to join Mardonios. Thus it fared with these who escorted the king on his way.,mashup

To be commanders of them there came Mardontes the son of Bagaios  and Arta�ntes the son of Artachaies  and with them also Ithamitres was in joint command  who was brother's son to Arta�ntes and had been added by the choice of Arta�ntes himself. They then  since they had suffered a heavy blow  did not advance further up towards the West  nor did any one compel them to do so; but they remained still in Samos and kept watch over Ionia  lest it should revolt  having three hundred ships including those of the Ionians; and they did not expect that the Hellenes on their part would come to Ionia  but thought that it would satisfy them to guard their own land  judging from the fact that they had not pursued after them in their flight from Salamis but were well contented then to depart homewards. As regards the sea then their spirit was broken  but on land they thought that Mardonios would get much the advantage. So they being at Samos were taking counsel to do some damage if they could to their enemies  and at the same time they were listening for news how the affairs of Mardonios would fall out.,mashup

When all the ships had arrived at Egina  there came Ionian envoys to the camp of the Hellenes  who also came a short time before this to Sparta and asked the Lacedemonians to set Ionia free; and of them one was Herodotus the son of Basileides. These had banded themselves together and had plotted to put to death Strattis the despot of Chios  being originally seven in number; but when one of those who took part with them gave information of it and they were discovered to be plotting against him  then the remaining six escaped from Chios and came both to Sparta and also at this time to Egina  asking the Hellenes to sail over to Ionia: but they with difficulty brought them forward as far as Delos; for the parts beyond this were all fearful to the Hellenes  since they were without experience of those regions and everything seemed to them to be filled with armed force  while their persuasion was that it was as long a voyage to Samos as to the Pillars of Heracles. Thus at the same time it so chanced that the Barbarians dared sail no further up towards the West than Samos  being smitten with fear  and the Hellenes no further down towards the East than Delos  when the Chians made request of them. So fear was guard of the space which lay between them.,mashup

This Mys is known to have come to Lebadeia and to have persuaded by payment of money one of the natives of the place to go down to Trophonios  and also he came to the Oracle at Abai of the Phokians; and moreover when he came for the first time to Thebes  he not only consulted the Ismenian Apollo — there one may consult just as at Olympia with victims — but also by payment he persuaded a stranger who was not a Theban  and induced him to lie down to sleep in the temple of Amphiaraos. In this temple no one of the Thebans is permitted to seek divination  and that for the following reason:— Amphiaraos dealing by oracles bade them choose which they would of these two things  either to have him as a diviner or else as an ally in war  abstaining from the other use; and they chose that he should be their ally in war: for this reason it is not permitted to any of the Thebans to lie down to sleep in that temple.,mashup

After this a thing which to me is a very great marvel is said by the Thebans to have come to pass:— it seems that this man Mys of Europos  as he journeyed round to all the Oracles  came also to the sacred enclosure of the Ptoan Apollo. This temple is calledPtoon  and belongs to the Thebans  and it lies above the lake Copais at the foot of the mountains  close to the town of Acraiphia. When the man called Mys came to this temple with three men chosen from the citizens in his company  who were sent by the public authority to write down that which the god should utter in his divination  forthwith it is said the prophet of the god began to give the oracle in a Barbarian tongue; and while those of the Thebans who accompanied him were full of wonder  hearing a Barbarian instead of the Hellenic tongue  and did not know what to make of the matter before them  it is said that the man of Europos  Mys  snatched from them the tablet which they bore and wrote upon it that which was being spoken by the prophet; and he said that the prophet was giving his answer in the Carian tongue: and then when he had written it  he went away and departed to Thessaly.,mashup

Mardonios having read that which the Oracles uttered  whatever that was  after this sent as an envoy to Athens Alexander the son of Amyntas  the Macedonian  both because the Persians were connected with him by marriage  (for Gygaia the sister of Alexander and daughter of Amyntas had been married to a Persian Bubares  and from her had been born to him that Amyntas who lived in Asia  having the name of his mother's father  to whom the king gave Alabanda  a great city of Phrygia  to possess )  and also Mardonios was sending him because he was informed that Alexander was a public guest-friend and benefactor of the Athenians; for by this means he thought that he would be most likely to gain over the Athenians to his side  about whom he heard that they were a numerous people and brave in war  and of whom he knew moreover that these were they who more than any others had brought about the disasters which had befallen the Persians by sea. Therefore if these should be added to him  he thought that he should easily have command of the sea (and this in fact would have been the case )  while on land he supposed himself to be already much superior in force. Thus he reckoned that his power would be much greater than that of the Hellenes. Perhaps also the Oracles told him this beforehand  counselling him to make the Athenian his ally  and so he was sending in obedience to their advice.,mashup

Now of this Alexander the seventh ancestor was that Perdiccas who first became despot of the Macedonians  and that in the manner which here follows:— From Argos there fled to the Illyrians three brothers of the descendents of Temenos  Gauanes  Aëropos  and Perdiccas; and passing over from the Illyrians into the upper parts of Macedonia they came to the city of Lebaia. There they became farm- servants for pay in the household of the king  one pasturing horses  the second oxen  and the youngest of them  namely Perdiccas  the smaller kinds of cattle; for in ancient times even those who were rulers over men were poor in money  and not the common people only; and the wife of the king cooked for them their food herself. And whenever she baked  the loaf of the boy their servant  namely Perdiccas  became double as large as by nature it should be. When this happened constantly in the same manner  she told it to her husband  and he when he heard it conceived forthwith that this was a portent and tended to something great. He summoned the farm-servants therefore  and gave notice to them to depart out of his land; and they said that it was right that before they went forth they should receive the wages which were due. Now it chanced that the sun was shining into the house down through the opening which received the smoke  and the king when he heard about the wages said  being infatuated by a divine power:I pay you then this for wages  and it is such as ye deserve  pointing to the sunlight. So then Gauanes and Aëropos the elder brothers stood struck with amazement when they heard this  but the boy  who happened to have in his hand a knife  said these words:We accept  O king  that which thou dost give; and he traced a line with his knife round the sunlight on the floor of the house  and having traced the line round he thrice drew of the sunlight into his bosom  and after that he departed both himself and his fellows.,mashup

They then were going away  and to the king one of those who sat by him at table told what manner of thing the boy had done  and how the youngest of them had taken that which was given with some design: and he hearing this and being moved with anger  sent after them horsemen to slay them. Now there is a river in this land to which the descendents of these men from Argos sacrifice as a saviour. This river  so soon as the sons of Temenos had passed over it  began to flow with such great volume of water that the horsemen became unable to pass over. So the brothers  having come to another region of Macedonia  took up their dwelling near the so-called gardens of Midas the son of Gordias  where roses grow wild which have each one sixty petals and excel all others in perfume. In these gardens too Silenos was captured  as is reported by the Macedonians: and above the gardens is situated a mountain called Bermion  which is inaccessible by reason of the cold. Having taken possession of that region  they made this their starting-point  and proceeded to subdue also the rest of Macedonia.,mashup

Thus then  I say  Alexander the son of Amyntas was descended; and when he came to Athens sent from Mardonios  he spoke as follows: Athenians  Mardonios speaks these words:— There has come to me a message from the king which speaks in this manner:— To the Athenians I remit all the offences which were committed against me: and now  Mardonios  thus do — first give them back their own land; then let them choose for themselves another in addition to this  whichsoever they desire  remaining independent; and set up for them again all their temples  which I set on fire  provided that they consent to make a treaty with me. This message having come to me  it is necessary for me to do so  unless by your means I am prevented: and thus I speak to you now:— Why are ye so mad as to raise up war against the king? since neither will ye overcome him  nor are ye able to hold out against him for ever: for ye saw the multitude of the host of Xerxes and their deeds  and ye are informed also of the power which is with me at the present time; so that even if ye overcome and conquer us (of which ye can have no hope if ye are rightly minded )  another power will come many times as large. Do not ye then desire to match yourselves with the king  and so to be both deprived of your land and for ever running a course for your own lives; but make peace with him: and ye have a most honourable occasion to make peace  since the king has himself set out upon this road: agree to a league with us then without fraud or deceit  and remain free.,mashup

If therefore ye do not make an agreement forthwith  when they offer you great things as the terms on which they are willing to make a treaty  I have fear on your behalf  seeing that ye dwell more upon the highway than any of your allies  and are exposed ever to destruction alone  the land which ye possess being parted off from the rest and lying between the armies which are contending together.

It happened moreover that they were introduced at the same time with Alexander; for the Athenians had waited for them  protracting the time  because they were well assured that the Lacedemonians would hear that an envoy had come from the Barbarians to make a treaty  and that having heard it they would themselves send envoys with all speed.

So when Alexander had ceased speaking  the envoys from Sparta followed him forthwith and said:As for us  the Lacedemonians sent us to ask of you not to make any change in that which concerns Hellas  nor to accept proposals from the Barbarian; since this is not just in any way nor honourable for any of the Hellenes to do  but least of all for you  and that for many reasons. Ye were they who stirred up this war  when we by no means willed it; and the contest came about for your dominion  but now it extends even to the whole of Hellas. Besides this it is by no means to be endured that ye Athenians  who are the authors of all this  should prove to be the cause of slavery to the Hellenes  seeing that ye ever from ancient time also have been known as the liberators of many. We feel sympathy however with you for your sufferings and because ye were deprived of your crops twice and have had your substance ruined now for a long time. In compensation for this the Lacedemonians and their allies make offer to support your wives and all those of your households who are unfitted for war  so long as this war shall last: but let not Alexander the Macedonian persuade you  making smooth the speech of Mardonios; for these things are fitting for him to do  since being himself a despot he is working in league with a despot: for you however they are not fitting to do  if ye chance to be rightly minded; for ye know that in Barbarians there is neither faith nor truth at all.

Nevertheless because we long for liberty we shall defend ourselves as we may be able: and do not thou endeavour to persuade us to make a treaty with the Barbarian  for we on our part shall not be persuaded. And now report to Mardonios that the Athenians say thus:— So long as the Sun goes on the same course by which he goes now  we will never make an agreement with Xerxes; but we will go forth to defend ourselves against him  trusting in the gods and the heroes as allies  for whom he had no respect when he set fire to their houses and to their sacred images. And in the future do not thou appear before the Athenians with any such proposals as these  nor think that thou art rendering them good service in advising them to do that which is not lawful; for we do not desire that thou shouldest suffer anything unpleasant at the hands of the Athenians  who art their public guest and friend.,mashup

To Alexander they thus made answer  but to the envoys from Sparta as follows:That the Lacedemonians should be afraid lest we should make a treaty with the Barbarian was natural no doubt; but it seems to be an unworthy fear for men who know so well the spirit of the Athenians  namely that there is neither so great quantity of gold anywhere upon the earth  nor any land so much excelling in beauty and goodness  that we should be willing to accept it and enslave Hellas by taking the side of the Medes. For many and great are the reasons which hinder us from doing this  even though we should desire it; first and greatest the images and houses of the gods set on fire or reduced to ruin  which we must necessarily avenge to the very utmost rather than make an agreement with him who did these deeds; then secondly there is the bond of Hellenic race  by which we are of one blood and of one speech  the common temples of the gods and the common sacrifices  the manners of life which are the same for all; to these it would not be well that the Athenians should become traitors. And be assured of this  if by any chance ye were not assured of it before  that so long as one of the Athenians remains alive  we will never make an agreement with Xerxes. We admire however the forethought which ye had with regard to us  in that ye took thought for us who have had our substance destroyed  and are willing to support the members of our households; and so far as ye are concerned  the kindness has been fully performed: but we shall continue to endure as we may  and not be a trouble in any way to you. Now therefore  with full conviction this is so  send out an army as speedily as ye may: for  as we conjecture  the Barbarian will be here invading our land at no far distant time but so soon as he shall be informed of the message sent  namely that we shall do none of those things which he desired of us. Therefore before he arrives here in Attica  it is fitting that ye come to our rescue quickly in Boeotia. Thus the Athenians made answer  and upon that the envoys went away back to Sparta.,mashup

Mardonios  when Alexander had returned back and had signified to him that which was said by the Athenians  set forth from Thessaly and began to lead his army with all diligence towards Athens: and to whatever land he came  he took up with him the people of that land. The leaders of Thessaly meanwhile did not repent of all that which had been done already  but on the contrary they urged on the Persian yet much more; and Thorax of Larissa had joined in escorting Xerxes in his flight and at this time he openly offered Mardonios passage to invade Hellas.,mashup

Then when the army in its march came to Boeotia  the Thebans endeavoured to detain Mardonios  and counselled him saying that there was no region more convenient for him to have his encampment than that; and they urged him not to advance further  but to sit down there and endeavour to subdue to himself the whole of Hellas without fighting: for to overcome the Hellenes by open force when they were united  as at the former time they were of one accord together  was a difficult task even for the whole world combined but  they proceeded if thou wilt do that which we advise  with little labour thou wilt have in thy power all their plans of resistance. Send money to the men who have power in their cities  and thus sending thou wilt divide Hellas into two parties: after that thou wilt with ease subdue by the help of thy party those who are not inclined to thy side.,mashup

Thus they advised  but he did not follow their counsel; for there had instilled itself into him a great desire to take Athens for the second time  partly from obstinacy and partly because he meant to signify to the king in Sardis that he was in possession of Athens by beacon-fires through the islands. However he did not even at this time find the Athenians there when he came to Attica; but he was informed that the greater number were either in Salamis or in the ships  and he captured the city finding it deserted. Now the capture of the city by the king had taken place ten months before the later expedition of Mardonios against it.,mashup

When Mardonios had come to Athens  he sent to Salamis Morychides a man of the Hellespont  bearing the same proposals as Alexander the Macedonian had brought over to the Athenians. These he sent for the second time  being aware beforehand that the dispositions of the Athenians were not friendly  but hoping that they would give way and leave their obstinacy  since the Attic land had been captured by the enemy and was in his power.,mashup

For this reason he sent Morychides to Salamis; and he came before the Council and reported the words of Mardonios. Then one of the Councillors  Lykidas  expressed the opinion that it was better to receive the proposal which Morychides brought before them and refer it to the assembly of the people. He  I say  uttered this opinion  whether because he had received money from Mardonios  or because this was his own inclination: however the Athenians forthwith  both those of the Council and those outside  when they heard of it  were very indignant  and they came about Lykidas and stoned him to death; but the Hellespontian Morychides they dismissed unhurt. Then when there had arisen much uproar in Salamis about Lykidas  the women of the Athenians heard of that which was being done  and one woman passing the word to another and one taking another with her  they went of their own accord to the house of Lykidas and stoned his wife and his children to death.,mashup

The Athenians had passed over to Salamis as follows:— So long as they were looking that an army should come from the Peloponnese to help them  they remained in Attica; but as those in Peloponnesus acted very slowly and with much delay  while the invader was said to be already in Boeotia  they accordingly removed everything out of danger  and themselves passed over to Salamis; and at the same time they sent envoys to Lacedemon to reproach the Lacedemonians for having permitted the Barbarian to invade Attica and for not having gone to Boeotia to meet him in company with them  and also to remind them how many things the Persian had promised to give the Athenians if they changed sides; bidding the envoys warn them that if they did not help the Athenians  the Athenians would find some shelter for themselves.,mashup

And when the envoys from the Athenians came to Lacedemon  bringing with them also envoys from Megara and Plataia  they came in before the Ephors and said as follows:,mashup

The Athenians sent us saying that the king of the Medes not only offers to give us back our land  but also desires to make us his allies on fair and equal terms without deceit or treachery  and is desirous moreover to give us another land in addition to our own  whichsoever we shall ourselves choose. We however  having respect for Zeus of the Hellenes and disdaining to be traitors to Hellas  did not agree but refused  although we were unjustly dealt with by the other Hellenes and left to destruction  and although we knew that it was more profitable to make a treaty with the Persian than to carry on war: nor shall we make a treaty at any future time  if we have our own will.

Now the leadership belonged to Pleistarchos the son of Leonidas; but he was yet a boy  and the other was his guardian and cousin: for Cleombrotos  the father of Pausanias and son of Anaxandrides  was no longer alive  but when he had led home from the Isthmus the army which had built the wall  no long time after this he died. Now the reason why Cleombrotos led home the army from the Isthmus was this:— as he was offering sacrifice for fighting against the Persian  the sun was darkened in the heaven. And Pausanias chose as commander in addition to himself Euryanax the son of Dorieos  a man of the same house.,mashup

So Pausanias with his army had gone forth out of Sparta; and the envoys  when day had come  not knowing anything of this going forth  came in before the Ephors meaning to depart also  each to his own State: and when they had come in before them they said these words:Ye  O Lacedemonians  are remaining here and celebrating this Hyakinthia and disporting yourselves  having left your allies to destruction; and the Athenians being wronged by you and for want of allies will make peace with the Persians on such terms as they can: and having made peace  evidently we become allies of the king  and therefore we shall join with him in expeditions against any land to which the Persians may lead us; and ye will learn then what shall be the issue for you of this matter. When the envoys spoke these words  the Ephors said and confirmed it with an oath  that they supposed by this time the men were at Orestheion on their way against the strangers: for they used to call the Barbariansstrangers. So they  not knowing of the matter  asked the meaning of these words  and asking they learnt all the truth; so that they were struck with amazement and set forth as quickly as possible in pursuit; and together with them five thousand chosen hoplites of the Lacedemoniandwellers in the country round did the same thing also.,mashup

They then  I say  were hastening towards the Isthmus; and the Argives so soon as they heard that Pausanias with his army had gone forth from Sparta  sent as a herald to Attica the best whom they could find of the long-distance runners  because they had before of their own motion engaged for Mardonios that they would stop the Spartans from going forth: and the herald when he came to Athens spoke as follows:Mardonios  the Argives sent me to tell thee that the young men have gone forth from Lacedemon  and that the Argives are not able to stop them from going forth: with regard to this therefore may it be thy fortune to take measures well.,mashup

He having spoken thus departed and went back; and Mardonios was by no means anxious any more to remain in Attica when he heard this message. Before he was informed of this he had been waiting  because he desired to know the news from the Athenians as to what they were about to do; and he had not been injuring or laying waste the land of Attica  because he hoped always that they would make a treaty with him; but as he did not persuade them  being now informed of everything he began to retire out of the country before the force of Pausanias arrived at the Isthmus  having first set fire to Athens and cast down and destroyed whatever was left standing of the walls  houses or temples. Now he marched away for this cause  namely first because Attica was not a land where horsemen could act freely  and also because  if he should be defeated in a battle in Attica  there was no way of retreat except by a narrow pass  so that a few men could stop them. He intended therefore to retreat to Thebes  and engage battle near to a friendly city and to a country where horsemen could act freely.,mashup

Mardonios then was retiring out of the way  and when he was already upon a road a message came to him saying that another body of troops in advance of the rest had come to Megara  consisting of a thousand Lacedemonians. Being thus informed he took counsel with himself  desiring if possible first to capture these. Therefore he turned back and proceeded to lead his army towards Megara  and the cavalry going in advance of the rest overran the Megaran land: this was the furthest land in Europe towards the sun-setting to which this Persian army came.,mashup

After this a message came to Mardonios that the Hellenes were assembled at the Isthmus; therefore he marched back by Dekeleia  for the chiefs of Boeotia had sent for those of the Asopians who dwelt near the line of march  and these were his guides along the road to Sphendaleis and thence to Tanagra. So having encamped for the night at Tanagra and on the next day having directed his march to Scolos  he was within the land of the Thebans. Then he proceeded to cut down the trees in the lands of the Thebans  although they were on the side of the Medes  moved not at all by enmity to them  but pressed by urgent necessity both to make a defence for his camp  and also he was making it for a refuge  in case that when he engaged battle things should not turn out for him as he desired. Now the encampment of his army extended from Erythrai along by Hysiai and reached the river Asopos: he was not however making the wall to extend so far as this  but with each face measuring somewhere about ten furlongs.,mashup

Now this which follows I heard from Thersander  an Orchomenian and a man of very high repute in Orchomenos. This Thersander said that he too was invited by Attaginos to this dinner  and there were invited also fifty men of the Thebans  and their host did not place them to recline separately each nation by themselves  but a Persian and a Theban upon every couch. Then when dinner was over  as they were drinking pledges to one another  the Persian who shared a couch with him speaking in the Hellenic tongue asked him of what place he was  and he answered that he was of Orchomenos. The other said:Since now thou hast become my table- companion and the sharer of my libation  I desire to leave behind with thee a memorial of my opinion  in order that thou thyself also mayest know beforehand and be able to take such counsels for thyself as may be profitable. Dost thou see these Persians who are feasting here  and the army which we left behind encamped upon the river? Of all these  when a little time has gone by  thou shalt see but very few surviving. While the Persian said these words he shed many tears  as Thersander reported; and he marvelling at his speech said to him:Surely then it is right to tell Mardonios and to those of the Persians who after him are held in regard. He upon this said:Friend  that which is destined to come from God  it is impossible for a man to avert; for no man is willing to follow counsel  even when one speaks that which is reasonable. And these things which I say many of us Persians know well; yet we go with the rest being bound in the bonds of necessity: and the most hateful grief of all human griefs is this  to have knowledge of the truth but no power over the event. These things I heard from Thersander of Orchomenos  and in addition to them this also  namely that he told them to various persons forthwith  before the battle took place at Plataia.,mashup

Mardonios then being encamped in Boeotia  the rest of the Hellenes who lived in these parts and took the side of the Medes were all supplying troops and had joined in the invasion of Attica  but the Phokians alone had not joined in the invasion — the Phokians  I say  for these too were now actively taking the side of the Medes  not of their own will however  but by compulsion. Not many days however after the arrival of Mardonios at Thebes  there came of them a thousand hoplites  and their leader was Harmokydes  the man who was of most repute among their citizens. When these too came to Thebes  Mardonios sent horsemen and bade the Phokians take up their position by themselves in the plain. After they had so done  forthwith the whole cavalry appeared; and upon this there went a rumour through the army of Hellenes which was with the Medes that the cavalry was about to shoot them down with javelins  and this same report went through the Phokians themselves also. Then their commander Harmokydes exhorted them  speaking as follows:Phokians  it is manifest that these men are meaning to deliver us to a death which we may plainly foresee  because we have been falsely accused by the Thessalians  as I conjecture: now therefore it is right that every one of you prove himself a good man; for it is better to bring our lives to an end doing deeds of valour and defending ourselves  than to be destroyed by a dishonourable death offering ourselves for the slaughter. Let each man of them learn that they are Barbarians and that we  against whom they contrived murder  are Hellenes.,mashup

While he was thus exhorting them  the horsemen having encompassed them round were riding towards them as if to destroy them; and they were already aiming their missiles as if about to discharge them  nay some perhaps did discharge them: and meanwhile the Phokians stood facing them gathered together and with their ranks closed as much as possible every way. Then the horsemen turned and rode away back. Now I am not able to say for certain whether they came to destroy the Phokians at the request of the Thessalians  and then when they saw them turn to defence they feared lest they also might suffer some loss  and therefore rode away back  for so Mardonios had commanded them; or whether on the other hand he desired to make trial of them and to see if they had in them any warlike spirit. Then  when the horsemen had ridden away back  Mardonios sent a herald and spoke to them as follows:Be of good courage  Phokians  for ye proved yourselves good men  and not as I was informed. Now therefore carry on this way with zeal  for ye will not surpass in benefits either myself or the king. Thus far it happened as regards the Phokians.,mashup

Now it happened by chance that the Megarians were posted in the place which was the most assailable of the whole position and to which the cavalry could best approach: so as the cavalry were making their attacks  the Megarians being hard pressed sent a herald to the commanders of the Hellenes  and the herald having come spoke these words:The Megarians say:— we  O allies  are not able by ourselves to sustain the attacks of the Persian cavalry  keeping this position where we took post at the first; nay  even hitherto by endurance and valour alone have we held out against them  hard pressed as we are: and now unless ye shall send some others to take up our position in succession to us  know that we shall leave the position in which we now are. The herald brought report to them thus; and upon this Pausanias made trial of the Hellenes  whether any others would voluntarily offer to go to this place and post themselves there in succession to the Megarians: and when the rest were not desirous to go  the Athenians undertook the task  and of the Athenians those three hundred picked men of whom Olympidoros the son of Lampon was captain.,mashup

These they were who undertook the task and were posted at Erythrai in advance of the other Hellenes who ere there present  having chosen to go with them the bow-men also. For some time then they fought  and at last an end was set to the fighting in the following manner:— while the cavalry was attacking by squadrons  the horse of Masistios  going in advance of the rest  was struck in the side by an arrow  and feeling pain he reared upright and threw Masistios off; and when he had fallen  the Athenians forthwith pressed upon him; and his horse they took and himself  as he made resistance  they slew  though at first they could not  for his equipment was of this kind — he wore a cuirass of gold scales underneath  and over the cuirass he had put on a crimson tunic. So as they struck upon the cuirass they could effect nothing  until some one  perceiving what the matter was  thrust into his eye. Then at length he fell and died; and by some means the other men of the cavalry had not observed this take place  for they neither saw him when he had fallen from his horse nor when he was being slain  and while the retreat and the turn were being made  they did not perceive that which was happening; but when they had stopped their horses  then at once they missed him  since there was no one to command them; and when they perceived what had happened  they passed the word to one another and all rode together  that they might if possible recover the body.,mashup

The Athenians upon that  seeing that the cavalry were riding to attack them no longer by squadrons but all together  shouted to the rest of the army to help them. Then while the whole number of those on foot were coming to their help  there arose a sharp fight for the body; and so long as the three hundred were alone they had much the worse and were about to abandon the body  but when the mass of the army came to their help  then the horsemen no longer sustained the fight  nor did they succeed in recovering the body; and besides him they lost others of their number also. Then they drew off about two furlongs away and deliberated what they should do; and it seemed good to them  as they had no commander  to ride back to Mardonios.,mashup

When the cavalry arrived at the camp  the whole army and also Mardonios made great mourning for Masistios  cutting off their own hair and that of their horses and baggage-animals and giving way to lamentation without stint; for all Boeotia was filled with the sound of it  because one had perished who after Mardonios was of the most account with the Persians and with the king.,mashup

The Barbarians then were paying honours in their own manner to Masistios slain: but the Hellenes  when they had sustained the attack of the cavalry and having sustained it had driven them back  were much more encouraged; and first they put the dead body in a cart and conveyed it along their ranks; and the body was a sight worth seeing for its size and beauty  wherefore also the men left their places in the ranks and went one after the other to gaze upon Masistios. After this they resolved to come down further towards Plataia; for the region of Plataia was seen to be much more convenient for them to encamp in than that of Erythrai  both for other reasons and because it is better watered. To this region then and to the spring Gargaphia  which is in this region  they resolved that they must come  and encamp in their several posts. So they took up their arms and went by the lower slopes of Kithairon past Hysiai to the Plataian land; and having there arrived they posted themselves according to their several nations near the spring Gargaphia and the sacred enclosure of Androcrates the hero  over low hills or level ground.,mashup

Then in the arranging of the several posts there arose a contention of much argument between the Tegeans and the Athenians; for they each claimed to occupy the other wing of the army themselves  alleging deeds both new and old. The Tegeans on the one hand said as follows:We have been always judged worthy of this post by the whole body of allies in all the common expeditions which the Peloponnesians have made before this  whether in old times or but lately  ever since that time when the sons of Heracles endeavoured after the death of Eurystheus to return to the Peloponnese. This honour we gained at that time by reason of the following event:— When with the Achaians and the Ionians who were then in Peloponnesus we had come out to the Isthmus to give assistance and were encamped opposite those who desired to return  then it is said that Hyllos made a speech saying that it was not right that the one army should risk its safety by engaging battle with the other  and urging that that man of the army of the Peloponnesians whom they should judge to be the best of them should fight in single combat with himself on terms concerted between them. The Peloponnesians then resolved that this should be done; and they made oath with one another on this condition — that if Hyllos should conquer the leader of the Peloponnesians  then the sons of Heracles should return to their father's heritage; but he should be conquered  then on the other hand the sons of Heracles should depart and lead away their army  and not within a hundred years attempt to return to the Peloponnese. There was selected then of all the allies  he himself making a voluntary offer  Echemos the son of Aëropos  the son of Phegeus  who was our commander and king: and he fought a single combat and slew Hyllos. By reason of this deed we obtained among the Peloponnesians of that time  besides many other great privileges which we still possess  this also of always leading the other wing of the army  when a common expedition is made. To you  Lacedemonians  we make no opposition  but we give you freedom of choice  and allow you to command whichever wing ye desire; but of the other we say that it belongs to us to be the leaders as in former time: and apart from this deed which has been related  we are more worthy than the Athenians to have this post; for in many glorious contests have we contended against you  O Spartans  and in many also against others. Therefore it is just that we have the other wing rather than the Athenians; for they have not achieved deeds such as ours  either new or old.,mashup

Thus they spoke  and the Athenians replied as follows:Though we know that this gathering was assembled for battle with the Barbarian and not for speech  yet since the Tegean has proposed to us as a task to speak of things both old and new  the deeds of merit namely which by each of our two nations have been achieved in all time  it is necessary for us to point out to you whence it comes that to us  who have been brave men always  it belongs as a heritage rather than to the Arcadians to have the chief place. First as to the sons of Heracles  whose leader they say that they slew at the Isthmus  these in the former time  when they were driven away by all the Hellenes to whom they came flying from slavery under those of Mykene  we alone received; and joining with them we subdued the insolence of Eurystheus. having conquered in fight those who then dwelt in Peloponnesus. Again when the Argives who with Polyneikes marched against Thebes  had been slain and were lying unburied  we declare that we marched an army against the Cadmeians and recovered the dead bodies and gave them burial in our own land at Eleusis. We have moreover another glorious deed performed against the Amazons who invaded once the Attic land  coming from the river Thermodon: and in the toils of Troy we were not inferior to any. But it is of no profit to make mention of these things; for on the one hand  though we were brave men in those times  we might now have become worthless  and on the other hand even though we were then worthless  yet now we might be better. Let it suffice therefore about ancient deeds; but if by us no other deed has been displayed (as many there have been and glorious  not less than by any other people of the Hellenes )  yet even by reason of the deed wrought at Marathon alone we are worthy to have this privilege and others besides this  seeing that we alone of all the Hellenes fought in single combat with the Persian  and having undertaken so great a deed we overcame and conquered six-and-forty nations. Are we not worthy then to have this post by reason of that deed alone? However  since at such a time as this it is not fitting to contend for post  we are ready to follow your saying  O Lacedemonians  as to where ye think it most convenient that we should stand and opposite to whom; for wheresoever we are posted  we shall endeavour to be brave men. Prescribe to us therefore and we shall obey. They made answer thus; and the whole body of the Lacedemonians shouted aloud that the Athenians were more worthy to occupy the wing than the Arcadians. Thus the Athenians obtained the wing  and overcame the Tegeans.,mashup

After this the Hellenes were ranged as follows  both those of them who came in continually afterwards and those who had come at the first. The right wing was held by ten thousand Lacedemonians; and of these the five thousand who were Spartans were attended by thirty-five thousand Helots serving as light-armed troops  seven of them appointed for each man. To stand next to themselves the Spartans chose the Tegeans  both to do them honour and also because of their valour; and of these there were one thousand five hundred hoplites. After these were stationed five thousand Corinthians  and they had obtained permission from Pausanias that the three hundred who were present of the men of Potidaia in Pallene should stand by their side. Next to these were stationed six hundred Arcadians of Orchomenos; and to these three thousand Sikyonians.

These all  excepting those who were appointed to attend the Spartans  seven for each man  were hoplites  being in number altogether three myriads eight thousand and seven hundred. This was the whole number of hoplites who were assembled against the Barbarian; and the number of the light-armed was as follows:— of the Spartan division thirty-five thousand men  reckoning at the rate of seven for each man  and of these every one was equipped for fighting; and the light-armed troops of the rest of the Lacedemonians and of the other Hellenes  being about one for each man  amounted to thirty-four thousand five hundred.,mashup

Meanwhile the Barbarians with Mardonios  when they had sufficiently mourned for Masistios  being informed that the Hellenes were at Plataia came themselves also to that part of the Asopos which flows there; and having arrived there  they were ranged against the enemy by Mardonios thus:— against the Lacedemonians he stationed the Persians; and since the Persians were much superior in numbers  they were arrayed in deeper ranks than those  and notwithstanding this they extended in front of the Tegeans also: and he ranged them in this manner — all the strongest part of that body he selected from the rest and stationed it opposite to the Lacedemonians  but the weaker part he ranged by their side opposite to the Tegeans. This he did on the information and suggestion of the Thebans. Then next to the Persians he ranged the Medes; and these extended in front of the Corinthians  Potidaians  Orchomenians and Sikyonians. Next to the Medes he ranged the Bactrians; and these extended in front of the Epidaurians  Troizenians  Lepreates  Tirynthians  Mykenians and Phliasians. After the Bactrians he stationed the Indians; and these extended in front of the Hermionians  Eretrians  Styrians and Chalkidians. Next to the Indians he ranged the Sacans  who extended in front of the men of Amprakia  the Anactorians  Leucadians  Palians and Eginetans. Next to the Sacans and opposite to the Athenians  Plataians and Megarians  he ranged the Boeotians  Locrians  Malians  Thessalians  and the thousand men of the Phokians: for not all the Phokians had taken the side of the Medes  but some of them were even supporting the cause of the Hellenes  being shut up in Parnassos; and setting out from thence they plundered from the army of Mardonios and from those of the Hellenes who were with him. He ranged the Macedonians also and those who dwell about the borders of Thessaly opposite to the Athenians.,mashup

These which have been named were the greatest of the nations who were arrayed in order by Mardonios  those  I mean  which were the most renowned and of greatest consideration: but there were in his army also men of several other nations mingled together  of the Phrygians  Thracians  Mysians  Paionians  and the rest; and among them also some Ethiopians  and of the Egyptians those called Hermotybians and Calasirians  carrying knives  who of all the Egyptians are the only warriors. These men  while he was yet at Phaleron  he had caused to disembark from the ships in which they served as fighting-men; for the Egyptians had not been appointed to serve in the land-army which came with Xerxes to Athens. Of the Barbarians then there were thirty myriads  as has been declared before; but of the Hellenes who were allies of Mardonios no man knows what the number was  for they were not numbered; but by conjecture I judge that these were assembled to the number of five myriads. These who were placed in array side by side were on foot; and the cavalry was ranged apart from them in a separate body.,mashup

When all had been drawn up by nations and by divisions  then on the next day they offered sacrifice on both sides. For the Hellenes Tisamenos the son of Antiochos was he who offered sacrifice  for he it was who accompanied this army as diviner. This man the Lacedemonians had made to be one of their own people  being an Eleian and of the race of the Iamidai: for when Tisamenos was seeking divination at Delphi concerning issue  the Pythian prophetess made answer to him that he should win five of the greatest contests. He accordingly  missing the meaning of the oracle  began to attend to athletic games  supposing that he should win contests of athletics; and he practised for thefive contests and came within one fall of winning a victory at the Olympic games  being set to contend with Hieronymos of Andros. The Lacedemonians however perceived that the oracle given to Tisamenos had reference not to athletic but to martial contests  and they endeavoured to persuade Tisamenos by payment of money  and to make him a leader in their wars together with the kings of the race of Heracles. He then  seeing that the Spartans set much store on gaining him over as a friend  having perceived this  I say  he raised his price and signified to them that he would do as they desired  if they would make him a citizen of their State and give him full rights  but for no other payment. The Spartans at first when they heard this displayed indignation and altogether gave up their request  but at last  when great terror was hanging over them of this Persian armament  they gave way and consented. He then perceiving that they had changed their minds  said that he could not now be satisfied even so  nor with these terms alone; but it was necessary that his brother Hegias also should be made a Spartan citizen on the same terms as he himself became one.,mashup

By saying this he followed the example of Melampus in his request  if one may compare royal power with mere citizenship; for Melampus on his part  when the women in Argos had been seized by madness  and the Argives endeavoured to hire him to come from Pylos and to cause their women to cease from the malady  proposed as payment for himself the half of the royal power; and the Argives did not suffer this  but departed: and afterwards  when more of their women became mad  at length they accepted that which Melampus had proposed  and went to offer him this: but he then seeing that they had changed their minds  increased his demand  and said that he would not do that which they desired unless they gave to his brother Bias also the third share in the royal power. And the Argives  being driven into straits  consented to this also.,mashup

Just so the Spartans also  being very much in need of Tisamenos  agreed with him on any terms which he desired: and when the Spartans had agreed to this demand also  then Tisamenos the Eleian  having become a Spartan  had part with them in winning five of the greatest contests as their diviner: and these were the only men who ever were made fellow- citizens of the Spartans. Now the five contests were these: one and the first of them was this at Plataia; and after this the contest at Tegea  which took place with the Tegeans and the Argives; then that at Dipaieis against all the Arcadians except the Mantineians; after that the contest with the Messenians at Ithome; and last of all that which took place at Tanagra against the Athenians and Argives. This  I say  was accomplished last of the five contests.,mashup

He then being in this evil case  seeing that he was running a course for his life and was likely moreover to suffer much torment before his death  had done a deed such as may hardly be believed. Being made fast on a block bound with iron  he obtained an iron tool  which in some way had been brought in  and contrived forthwith a deed the most courageous of any that we know: for having first calculated how the remaining portion of his foot might be got out of the block  he cut away the flat of his own foot  and after that  since he was guarded still by warders  he broke through the wall and so ran away to Tegea  travelling during the nights and in the daytime entering a wood and resting there; so that  though the Lacedemonians searched for him in full force  he arrived at Tegea on the third night; and the Lacedemonians were possessed by great wonder both at his courage  when they saw the piece of the foot that was cut off lying there  and also because they were not able to find him. So he at that time having thus escaped them took refuge at Tegea  which then was not friendly with the Lacedemonians; and when he was healed and had procured for himself a wooden foot  he became an open enemy of the Lacedemonians. However in the end the enmity into which he had fallen with the Lacedemonians was not to his advantage; for he was caught by them while practising divination in Zakynthos  and was put to death.,mashup

However the death of Hegesistratos took place later than the events at Plataia  and he was now at the Asopos  having been hired by Mardonions for no mean sum  sacrificing and displaying zeal for his cause both on account of his enmity with the Lacedemonians and on account of the gain which he got: but as the sacrifices were not favourable for a battle either for the Persians themselves or for those Hellenes who were with them (for these also had a diviner for themselves  Hippomachos a Leucadian )  and as the Hellenes had men constantly flowing in and were becoming more in number  Timagenides the son of Herpys  a Theban  counselled Mardonios to set a guard on the pass of Kithairon  saying that the Hellenes were constantly flowing in every day and that he would thus cut off large numbers.,mashup

Eight days had now passed while they had been sitting opposite to one another  when he gave this counsel to Mardonios; and Mardonios  perceiving that the advice was good  sent the cavalry when night came on to the pass of Kithairon leading towards Plataia  which the Boeotians call theThree Heads and the Athenians theOak Heads. Having been thus sent  the cavalry did not come without effect  for they caught five hundred baggage-animals coming out into the plain  which were bearing provisions from Peloponnesus to the army  and also the men who accompanied the carts: and having taken this prize the Persians proceeded to slaughter them without sparing either beast or man; and when they were satiated with killing they surrounded the rest and drove them into the camp to Mardonios.,mashup

After this deed they spent two days more  neither side wishing to begin a battle; for the Barbarians advanced as far as the Asopos to make trial of the Hellenes  but neither side would cross the river. However the cavalry of Mardonios made attacks continually and did damage to the Hellenes; for the Thebans  being very strong on the side of the Medes  carried on the war with vigour  and always directed them up to the moment of fighting; and after this the Persians and Medes took up the work and were they who displayed valour in their turn.,mashup

For ten days then nothing more was done than this; but when the eleventh day had come  while they still sat opposite to one another at Plataia  the Hellenes having by this time grown much more numerous and Mardonios being greatly vexed at the delay of action  then Mardonios the son of Gobryas and Artabazos the son of Pharnakes  who was esteemed by Xerxes as few of the Persians were besides  came to speech with one another; and as they conferred  the opinions they expressed were these — that of Artabazos  that they must put the whole army in motion as soon as possible and go to the walls of the Thebans  whither great stores of corn had been brought in for them and fodder for their beasts; and that they should settle there quietly and get their business done as follows:— they had  he said  great quantities of gold  both coined and uncoined  and also of silver and of drinking- cups; and these he advised they should send about to the Hellenes without stint  more especially to those of the Hellenes who were leaders in their several cities; and these  he said  would speedily deliver up their freedom: and he advised that they should not run the risk of a battle. His opinion then was the same as that of the Thebans  for he as well as they had some true foresight: but the opinion of Mardonios was more vehement and more obstinate  and he was by no means disposed to yield; for he said that he thought their army far superior to that of the Hellenes  and he gave as his opinion that they should engage battle as quickly as possible and not allow them to assemble in still greater numbers than were already assembled; and as for the sacrifices of Hegesistratos  they should leave them alone and not endeavour to force a good sign  but follow the custom of the Persians and engage battle.,mashup

When he so expressed his judgment  none opposed him  and thus his opinion prevailed; for he and not Artabazos had the command of the army given him by the king. He summoned therefore the commanders of the divisions and the generals of those Hellenes who were with him  and asked whether they knew of any oracle regarding the Persians  which said that they should be destroyed in Hellas; and when those summoned to council were silent  some not knowing the oracles and others knowing them but not esteeming it safe to speak  Mardonios himself said:Since then ye either know nothing or do not venture to speak  I will tell you  since I know very well. There is an oracle saying that the Persians are destined when they come to Hellas to plunder the temple at Delphi  and having plundered it to perish every one of them. We therefore  just because we know this  will not go to that temple nor will we attempt to plunder it; and for this cause we shall not perish. So many of you therefore as chance to wish well to the Persians  have joy so far as regards this matter  and be assured that we shall overcome the Hellenes. Having spoken to them thus  he next commanded to prepare everything and to set all in order  since at dawn of the next day a battle would be fought.,mashup

After the inquiry about the oracles and the exhortation given by Mardonios night came on and the guards were set: and when night was far advanced  and it seemed that there was quiet everywhere in the camps  and that the men were in their deepest sleep  then Alexander the son of Amyntas  commander and king of the Macedonians  rode his horse up to the guard-posts of the Athenians and requested that he might have speech with their generals. So while the greater number of the guards stayed at their posts  some ran to the generals  and when they reached them they said that a man had come riding on a horse out of the camp of the Medes  who discovered nothing further  but only named the generals and said that he desired to have speech with them.,mashup

I say then that Mardonios and his army cannot get the offerings to be according to their mind  for otherwise ye would long ago have fought. Now however he has resolved to let the offerings alone and to bring on a battle at dawn of day; for  as I conjecture  he fears lest ye should assemble in greater numbers. Therefore prepare yourselves; and if after all Mardonios should put off the battle and not bring it on  stay where ye are and hold out patiently; for they have provisions only for a few days remaining. And if this way shall have its issue according to your mind  then each one of you ought to remember me also concerning liberation  since I have done for the sake of the Hellenes so hazardous a deed by reason of my zeal for you  desiring to show you the design of Mardonios  in order that the Barbarians may not fall upon you when ye are not as yet expecting them: and I am Alexander the Macedonian.

Then the generals of the Athenians came to the right wing and told Pausanias that which they had heard from Alexander. Upon this saying he being struck with fear of the Persians spoke as follows:Since then at dawn the battle comes on  it is right that ye  Athenians  should take your stand opposite to the Persians  and we opposite to the Boeotians and those Hellenes who are now posted against you; and for this reason  namely because ye are acquainted with the Medes and with their manner of fighting  having fought with them at Marathon  whereas we have had no experience of these men and are without knowledge of them; for not one of the Spartans has made trial of the Medes in fight  but of the Boeotians and Thessalians we have had experience. It is right therefore that ye should take up your arms and come to this wing of the army  and that we should go to the left wing. In answer to this the Athenians spoke as follows:To ourselves also long ago at the very first  when we saw that the Persians were being ranged opposite to you  it occurred to us to say these very things  which ye now bring forward before we have uttered them; but we feared lest these words might not be pleasing to you. Since however ye yourselves have made mention of this  know that your words have caused us pleasure  and that we are ready to do this which ye say.,mashup

Both then were content to do this  and as dawn appeared they began to change their positions with one another: and the Boeotians perceiving that which was being done reported it to Mardonios  who  when he heard it  forthwith himself also endeavoured to change positions  bringing the Persians along so as to be against the Lacedemonians: and when Pausanias learnt that this was being done  he perceived that he was not unobserved  and he led the Spartans back again to the right wing; and just so also did Mardonios upon his left.,mashup

When they had been thus brought to their former positions  Mardonios sent a herald to the Spartans and said as follows:Lacedemonians  ye are said forsooth by those who are here to be very good men  and they have admiration for you because ye do not flee in war nor leave your post  but stay there and either destroy your enemies or perish yourselves. In this however  as it now appears  there is no truth; for before we engaged battle and came to hand-to- hand conflict we saw you already flee and leave your station  desiring to make the trial with the Athenians first  while ye ranged yourselves opposite to our slaves. These are not at all the deeds of good men in war  but we were deceived in you very greatly; for we expected by reason of your renown that ye would send a herald to us  challenging us and desiring to fight with the Persians alone; but though we on our part were ready to do this  we did not find that ye said anything of this kind  but rather that ye cowered with fear. Now therefore since ye were not the first to say this  we are the first. Why do we not forthwith fight  ye on behalf of the Hellenes  since ye have the reputation of being the best  and we on behalf of the Barbarians  with equal numbers on both sides? and if we think it good that the others should fight also  then let them fight afterwards; and if on the other hand we should not think it good  but think it sufficient that we alone should fight  then let us fight it out to the end  and whichsoever of us shall be the victors  let these be counted as victorious with their whole army.,mashup

The herald having thus spoken waited for some time  and then  as no one made him any answer  he departed and went back; and having returned he signified to Mardonios that which had happened to him. Mardonios then being greatly rejoiced and elated by his empty victory  sent the cavalry to attack the Hellenes: and when the horsemen had ridden to attack them  they did damage to the whole army of the Hellenes by hurling javelins against them and shooting with bows  being mounted archers and hard therefore to fight against: and they disturbed and choked up the spring Gargaphia  from which the whole army of the Hellenes was drawing its water. Now the Lacedemonians alone were posted near this spring  and it was at some distance from the rest of the Hellenes  according as they chanced to be posted  while the Asopos was near at hand; but when they were kept away from the Asopos  then they used to go backwards and forwards to this spring; for they were not permitted by the horsemen and archers to fetch water from the river.,mashup

It was resolved then by the generals in council with one another  that if the Persians put off the battle for that day  they would go to the Island. This is distant ten furlongs from the Asopos and the spring Gargaphia  where they were then encamped  and is in front of the city of the Plataians: and if it be asked how there can be an island on the mainland  thus it is:— the river parts in two above  as it flows from Kithairon down to the plain  keeping a distance of about three furlongs between its streams  and after that it joins again in one stream; and the name of it is Oëroe  said by the natives of the country to be the daughter of Asopos. To this place of which I speak they determined to remove  in order that they might be able to get an abundant supply of water and that the cavalry might not do them damage  as now when they were right opposite. And they proposed to remove when the second watch of the night should have come  so that the Persians might not see them set forth and harass them with the cavalry pursuing. They proposed also  after they had arrived at this place  round which  as I say  Oëroe the daughter of Asopos flows  parting into two streams as she runs from Kithairon  to send half the army to Kithairon during this same night  in order to take up their attendants who had gone to get the supplies of provisions; for these were cut off from them in Kithairon.,mashup

Having thus resolved  during the whole of that day they had trouble unceasingly  while the cavalry pressed upon them; but when the day drew to a close and the attacks of the cavalry had ceased  then as it was becoming night and the time had arrived at which it had been agreed that they should retire from their place  the greater number of them set forth and began to retire  not however keeping it in mind to go to the place which had been agreed upon; but on the contrary  when they had begun to move  they readily took occasion to flee from the cavalry towards the city of the Plataians  and in their flight they came as far as the temple of Hera  which temple is in front of the city of the Plataians at a distance of twenty furlongs from the spring Gargaphia; and when they had there arrived they halted in front of the temple.,mashup

These then were encamping about the temple of Hera; and Pausanias  seeing that they were retiring from the camp  gave the word to the Lacedemonians also to take up their arms and go after the others who were preceding them  supposing that these were going to the place to which they had agreed to go. Then  when all the other commanders were ready to obey Pausanias  Amompharetos the son of Poliades  the commander of the Pitanate division  said that he would not flee from the strangers  nor with his own will would he disgrace Sparta; and he expressed wonder at seeing that which was being done  not having been present at the former discussion. And Pausanias and Euryanax were greatly disturbed that he did not obey them and still more that they should be compelled to leave the Pitanate division behind  since he thus refused; for they feared that if they should leave it in order to do that which they had agreed with the other Hellenes  both Amompharetos himself would perish being left behind and also the men with him. With this thought they kept the Lacedemonian force from moving  and meanwhile they endeavoured to persuade him that it was not right for him to do so.,mashup

They then were exhorting Amompharetos  who had been left behind alone of the Lacedemonians and Tegeans; and meanwhile the Athenians were keeping themselves quiet in the place where they had been posted  knowing the spirit of the Lacedemonians  that they were apt to say otherwise than they really meant; and when the army began to move  they sent a horseman from their own body to see whether the Spartans were attempting to set forth  or whether they had in truth no design at all to retire; and they bade him ask Pausanias what they ought to do.,mashup

So when the herald came to the Lacedemonians  he saw that they were still in their place and that the chiefs of them had come to strife with one another: for when Euryanax and Pausanias both exhorted Amompharetos not to run the risk of remaining behind with his men  alone of all the Lacedemonians  they did not at all persuade him  and at last they had come to downright strife; and meanwhile the herald of the Athenians had arrived and was standing by them. And Amompharetos in his contention took a piece of rock in both his hands and placed it at the feet of Pausanias  saying that with this pebble he gave his vote not to fly from the strangers  meaning the Barbarians. Pausanias then  calling him a madman and one who was not in his right senses  bade tell the state of their affairs to the Athenian herald  who was asking that which he had been charged to ask; and at the same time he requested the Athenians to come towards the Lacedemonians and to do in regard to the retreat the same as they did.,mashup

He then went away back to the Athenians; and as the dawn of day found them yet disputing with one another  Pausanias  who had remained still throughout all this time  gave the signal  and led away all the rest over the low hills  supposing that Amonpharetos would not stay behind when the other Lacedemonians departed (in which he was in fact right ); and with them also went the Tegeans. Meanwhile the Athenians  following the commands which were given them  were going in the direction opposite to that of the Lacedemonians; for these were clinging to the hills and the lower slope of Kithairon from fear of the cavalry  while the Athenians were marching below in the direction of the plain.,mashup

As for Amonpharetos  he did not at first believe that Pausanias would ever venture to leave him and his men behind  and he stuck to it that they should stay there and not leave their post; but when Pausanias and his troops were well in front  then he perceived that they had actually left him behind  and he made his division take up their arms and led them slowly towards the main body. This  when it had got away about ten furlongs  stayed for the division of Amompharetos  halting at the river Moloeis and the place called Argiopion  where also there stands a temple of the Eleusinian Demeter: and it stayed there for this reason  namely in order that of Amonpharetos and his division should not leave the place where they had been posted  but should remain there  it might be able to come back to their assistance. So Amompharetos and his men were coming up to join them  and the cavalry also of the Barbarians was at the same time beginning to attack them in full force: for the horsemen did on this day as they had been wont to do every day; and seeing the place vacant in which the Hellenes had been posted on the former days  they rode their horses on continually further  and as soon as they came up with them they began to attack them.,mashup

For ye who dwell near them were wont to say that the Lacedemonians did not fly from a battle  but were men unsurpassed in war; and these men ye not only saw before this changing from their post  but now we all of us see that they have run away during the past night; and by this they showed clearly  when the time came for them to contend in battle with those who were in truth the best of all men  that after all they were men of no worth  who had been making a display of valour among Hellenes  a worthless race. As for you  since ye had had no experience of the Persians  I for my part was very ready to excuse you when ye praised these  of whom after all ye knew something good; but much more I marvelled at Artabazos that  he  should have been afraid of the Lacedemonians  and that having been afraid he should have uttered that most cowardly opinion  namely that we ought to move our army away and go to the city of the Thebans to be besieged there — an opinion about which the king shall yet be informed by me. Of these things we will speak in another place; now however we must not allow them to act thus  but we must pursue them until they are caught and pay the penalty to us for all that they did to the Persians in time past.,mashup

If however anything has happened to you which makes it impossible for you to come to our help  then do us a kindness by sending to us the archers; and we know that ye have been in the course of this present war by far the most zealous of all  so that ye will listen to our request in this matter also.,mashup

When the Athenians heard this they were desirous to come to their help and to assist them as much as possible; and as they were already going  they were attacked by those of the Hellenes on the side of the king who had been ranged opposite to them  so that they were no longer able to come to the help of the Lacedemonians  for the force that was attacking them gave them much trouble. Thus the Lacedemonians and Tegeans were left alone  being in number  together with light-armed men  the former fifty thousand and the Tegeans three thousand; for these were not parted at all from the Lacedemonians: and they began to offer sacrifice  meaning to engage battle with Mardonios and the force which had come against them. Then since their offerings did not prove favourable  and many of them were being slain during this time and many more wounded — for the Persians had made a palisade of their wicker-work shields and were discharging their arrows in great multitude and without sparing — Pausanias  seeing that the Spartans were hard pressed and that the offerings did not prove favourable  fixed his gaze upon the temple of Hera of the Plataians and called upon the goddess to help  praying that they might by no means be cheated of their hope:,mashup

So when this at length came to pass  then they also advanced against the Persians; and the Persians put away their bows and came against them. Then first there was fighting about the wicker-work shields  and when these had been overturned  after that the fighting was fierce by the side of the temple of Demeter  and so continued for a long time  until at last they came to justling; for the Barbarians would take hold of the spears and break them off. Now in courage and in strength the Persians were not inferior to the others  but they were without defensive armour  and moreover they were unversed in war and unequal to their opponents in skill; and they would dart out one at a time or in groups of about ten together  some more and some less  and fall upon the Spartans and perish.,mashup

When the Persians were turned to flight at Plataia by the Lacedemonians  they fled in disorder to their own camp and to the palisade which they had made in the Theban territory: and it is a marvel to me that  whereas they fought by the side of the sacred grove of Demeter  not one of the Persians was found to have entered the enclosure or to have been slain within it  but round about the temple in the unconsecrated ground fell the greater number of the slain.

Thus far then had this battle proceeded: but Artabazos the son of Pharnakes had been displeased at the very first because Mardonios remained behind after the king was gone; and afterwards he had been bringing forward objections continually and doing nothing  but had urged them always not to fight a battle: and for himself he acted as follows  not being pleased with the things which were being done by Mardonios.— The men of whom Artabazos was commander (and he had with him no small force but one which was in number as much as four myriads of men )  these  when the fighting began  being well aware what the issue of the battle would be  he led carefully  having first given orders that all should go by the way which he should lead them and at the same pace at which they should see him go. Having given these orders he led his troops on pretence of taking them into battle; and when he was well on his way  he saw the Persians already taking flight. Then he no longer led his men in the same order as before  but set off at a run  taking flight by the quickest way not to the palisade nor yet to the wall of the Thebans  but towards Phokis  desiring as quickly as possible to reach the Hellespont.,mashup

And this is an additional proof to me that all the fortunes of the Barbarians depended upon the Persians  namely that at that time these men fled before they had even engaged with the enemy  because they saw the Persians doing so. Thus all were in flight except only the cavalry  including also that of the Boeotians; and this rendered service to the fugitives by constantly keeping close to the enemy and separating the fugitives of their own side from the Hellenes.,mashup

Then when the Lacedemonians came up to attack it  there began between them a vigorous fight for the wall: for so long as the Athenians were away  they defended themselves and had much the advantage over the Lacedemonians  since these did not understand the art of fighting against walls; but when the Athenians came up to help them  then there was a fierce fight for the wall  lasting for a long time  and at length by valour and endurance the Athenians mounted up on the wall and made a breach in it  through which the Hellenes poured in. Now the Tegeans were the first who entered the wall  and these were they who plundered the tent of Mardonios  taking  besides the other things which were in it  also the manger of his horse  which was all of bronze and a sight worth seeing. This manger of Mardonios was dedicated by the Tegeans as an offering in the temple of Athene Alea  but all the other things which they took  they brought to the common stock of the Hellenes. The Barbarians however  after the wall had been captured  no longer formed themselves into any close body  nor did any of them think of making resistance  but they were utterly at a loss  as you might expect from men who were in a panic with many myriads of them shut up together in a small space: and the Hellenes were able to slaughter them so that out of an army of thirty myriads  if those four be subtracted which Artabazos took with him in his flight  of the remainder not three thousand men survived. Of the Lacedemonians from Sparta there were slain in the battle ninety-one in all  of the Tegeans sixteen  and of the Athenians two-and-fifty.,mashup

Among the Barbarians those who proved themselves the best men were  of those on foot the Persians  and of the cavalry the Sacans  and for a single man Mardonios it is said was the best. Of the Hellenes  though both the Tegeans and the Athenians proved themselves good men  yet the Lacedemonians surpassed them in valour. Of this I have no other proof (for all these were victorious over their opposites )  but only this  that they fought against the strongest part of the enemy's force and overcame it. And the man who proved himself in my opinion by much the best was that Aristodemos who  having come back safe from Thermopylai alone of the three hundred  had reproach and dishonour attached to him. After him the best were Poseidonios and Philokyon and Amompharetos the Spartan. However  when there came to be conversation as to which of them had proved himself the best  the Spartans who were present gave it as their opinion that Aristodemos had evidently wished to be slain in consequence of the charge which lay against him  and so  being as it were in a frenzy and leaving his place in the ranks  he had displayed great deeds  whereas Poseidonios had proved himself a good man although he did not desire to be slain; and so far he was the better man of the two. This however they perhaps said from ill-will; and all these whose names I mentioned among the men who were killed in this battle  were specially honoured  except Aristodemos; but Aristodemos  since he desired to be slain on account of the before-mentioned charge  was not honoured.,mashup

For when of old the sons of Tyndareus invaded the Attic land with a great host  in order to bring home Helen  and were laying waste the demes  not knowing to what place of hiding Helen had been removed  then they say that the men of Dekeleia  or as some say Dekelos himself  being aggrieved by the insolence of Theseus and fearing for all the land of the Athenians  told them the whole matter and led them to Aphidnai  which Titakos who was sprung from the soil delivered up by treachery to the sons of Tyndareus. In consequence of this deed the Dekeleians have had continually freedom from dues in Sparta and front seats at the games  privileges which exist still to this day; insomuch that even in the war which many years after these events arose between the Athenians and the Peloponnesians  when the Lacedemonians laid waste all the rest of Attica  they abstained from injury to Dekeleia.,mashup

To this deme belonged Sophanes  who showed himself the best of all the Athenians in this battle; and of him there are two different stories told: one that he carried an anchor of iron bound by chains of bronze to the belt of his corslet; and this he threw whensoever he came up with the enemy  in order  they say  that the enemy when they came forth out of their ranks might not be able to move him from his place; and when a flight of his opponents took place  his plan was to take up the anchor first and then pursue after them. This story is reported thus; but the other of the stories  disputing the truth of that which has been told above  is reported as follows  namely that upon his shield  which was ever moving about and never remaining still  he bore an anchor as a device  and not one of iron bound to his corslet.,mashup

There was another illustrious deed done too by Sophanes; for when the Athenians besieged Egina he challenged to a fight and slew Eurybates the Argive  one who had been victor in the five contests at the games. To Sophanes himself it happened after these events that when he was general of the Athenians together with Leagros the son of Glaucon  he was slain after proving himself a good man by the Edonians at Daton  fighting for the gold mines.,mashup

When the Barbarians had been laid low by the Hellenes at Plataia  there approached to these a woman  the concubine of Pharandates the son of Teaspis a Persian  coming over of her own free will from the enemy  who when she perceived that the Persians had been destroyed and that the Hellenes were the victors  descended from her carriage and came up to the Lacedemonians while they were yet engaged in the slaughter. This woman had adorned herself with many ornaments of gold  and her attendants likewise  and she had put on the fairest robe of those which she had; and when she saw that Pausanias was directing everything there  being well acquainted before with his name and with his lineage  because she had heard it often  she recognised Pausanias and taking hold of his knees she said these words:O king of Sparta  deliver me thy suppliant from the slavery of the captive: for thou hast also done me service hitherto in destroying these  who have regard neither for demigods nor yet for gods. I am by race of Cos  the daughter of Hegetorides the son of Antagoras; and the Persian took me by force in Cos and kept me a prisoner. He made answer in these words:Woman  be of good courage  both because thou art a suppliant  and also if in addition to this it chances that thou art speaking the truth and art the daughter of Hegetorides the Coan  who is bound to me as a guest-friend more than any other of the men who dwell in those parts. Having thus spoken  for that time her gave her in charge to those Ephors who were present  and afterwards he sent her away to Egina  whither she herself desired to go.,mashup

After the arrival of the woman  forthwith upon this arrived the Mantineians  when all was over; and having learnt that they had come too late for the battle  they were greatly grieved  and said that they deserved to be punished: and being informed that the Medes with Artabazos were in flight  they pursued after them as far as Thessaly  though the Lacedemonians endeavoured to prevent them from pursuing after fugitives. Then returning back to their own country they sent the leaders of their army into exile from the land. After the Mantineians came the Eleians; and they  like the Mantineians  were greatly grieved by it and so departed home; and these also when they had returned sent their leaders into exile.

At Plataia among the troops of the Eginetans was Lampon the son of Pytheas  one of the leading men of the Eginetans  who was moved to go to Pausanias with a most impious proposal  and when he had come with haste  he said as follows:Son of Cleombrotos  a deed has been done by thee which is of marvellous greatness and glory  and to thee God has permitted by rescuing Hellas to lay up for thyself the greatest renown of all the Hellenes about whom we have any knowledge. Do thou then perform also that which remains to do after these things  in order that yet greater reputation may attach to thee  and also that in future every one of the Barbarians may beware of being the beginner of presumptuous deeds towards the Hellenes. For when Leonidas was slain at Thermopylai  Mardonios and Xerxes cut off his head and crucified him: to him therefore do thou repay like with like  and thou shalt have praise first from all the Spartans and then secondly from the other Hellenes also; for if thou impale the body of Mardonios  thou wilt then have taken vengeance for Leonidas thy father's brother.,mashup

He said this thinking to give pleasure; but the other made him answer in these words:Stranger of Egina  I admire thy friendly spirit and thy forethought for me  but thou hast failed of a good opinion nevertheless: for having exalted me on high and my family and my deed  thou didst then cast me down to nought by advising me to do outrage to a dead body  and by saying that if I do this I shall be better reported of. These things it is more fitting for Barbarians to do than for Hellenes; and even with them we find fault for doing so. However that may be  I do not desire in any such manner as this to please either Eginetans or others who like such things; but it is enough for me that I should keep from unholy deeds  yea and from unholy speech also  and so please the Spartans.

He having heard this went his way; and Pausanias made a proclamation that none should lay hands upon the spoil  and he ordered the Helots to collect the things together. They accordingly dispersed themselves about the camp and found tents furnished with gold and silver  and beds overlaid with gold and overlaid with silver  and mixing-bowls of gold  and cups and other drinking vessels. They found also sacks laid upon waggons  in which there proved to be caldrons both of gold and of silver; and from the dead bodies which lay there they stripped bracelets and collars  and also their swords if they were of gold  for as to embroidered raiment  there was no account made of it. Then the Helots stole many of the things and sold them to the Eginetans  but many things also they delivered up  as many of them as they could not conceal; so that the great wealth of the Eginetans first came from this  that they bought the gold from the Helots making pretence that it was brass.,mashup

How much was set apart and given to those of them who had proved themselves the best men at Plataia is not reported by any  though for my part I suppose that gifts were made to these also; Pausanias however had ten of each thing set apart and given to him  that is women  horses  talents  camels  and so also of the other things.,mashup

It is said moreover that this was done which here follows  namely that Xerxes in his flight from Hellas had left to Mardonios the furniture of his own tent  and Pausanias accordingly seeing the furniture of Mardonios furnished with gold and silver and hangings of different colours ordered the bakers and the cooks to prepare a meal as they were used to do for Mardonios. Then when they did this as they had been commanded  it is said that Pausanias seeing the couches of gold and of silver with luxurious coverings  and the tables of gold and silver  and the magnificent apparatus of the feast  was astonished at the good things set before him  and for sport he ordered his own servants to prepare a Laconian meal; and as  when the banquet was served  the difference between the two was great  Pausanias laughed and sent for the commanders of the Hellenes; and when these had come together  Pausanias said  pointing to the preparation of the two meals severally:Hellenes  for this reason I assembled you together  because I desired to show you the senselessness of this leader of the Medes  who having such fare as this  came to us who have such sorry fare as ye see here  in order to take it away from us.

He then was buried in some such manner as this: and the Hellenes when they had divided the spoil at Plataia proceeded to bury their dead  each nation apart by themselves. The Spartans made for themselves three several burial-places  one in which they buried the younger Spartans  of whom also were Poseidonios  Amompharetos  Philokyon and Callicrates — in one of the graves  I say  were laid the younger men  in the second the rest of the Spartans  and in the third the Helots. These then thus buried their dead; but the Tegeans buried theirs all together in a place apart from these  and the Athenians theirs together; and the Megarians and Phliasians those who had been slain by the cavalry. Of all these the burial-places had bodies laid in them  but as to the burial-places of other States which are to be seen at Plataia  these  as I am informed  are all mere mounds of earth without any bodies in them  raised by the several peoples on account of posterity  because they were ashamed of their absence from the fight; for among others there is one there called the burial-place of the Eginetans  which I hear was raised at the request of the Eginetans by Cleades the son of Autodicos  a man of Plataia who was their public guest-friend  no less than ten years after these events.,mashup

When the Hellenes had buried their dead at Plataia  forthwith they determined in common council to march upon Thebes and to ask the Thebans to surrender those who had taken the side of the Medes  and among the first of them Timagenides and Attaginos  who were leaders equal to the first; and if the Thebans did not give them up  they determined not to retire from the city until they had taken it. Having thus resolved  they came accordingly on the eleventh day after the battle and began to besiege the Thebans  bidding them give the men up: and as the Thebans refused to give them up  they began to lay waste their land and also to attack their wall.,mashup

So then  as they did not cease their ravages  on the twentieth day Timagenides spoke as follows to the Thebans:Thebans  since it has been resolved by the Hellenes not to retire from the siege until either they have taken Thebes or ye have delivered us up to them  now therefore let not the land of Boeotia suffer any more for our sakes  but if they desire to have money and are demanding our surrender as a colour for this  let us give them money taken out of the treasury of the State; for we took the side of the Medes together with the State and not by ourselves alone: but if they are making the siege truly in order to get us into their hands  then we will give ourselves up for trial. In this it was thought that he spoke very well and seasonably  and the Thebans forthwith sent a herald to Pausanias offering to deliver up the men.,mashup

Artabazos meanwhile  the son of Pharnakes  in his flight from Plataia was by this time getting forward on his way: and the Thessalians  when he came to them  offered him hospitality and inquired concerning the rest of the army  not knowing anything of that which had happened at Plataia; and Artabazos knowing that if he should tell them the whole truth about the fighting  he would run the risk of being destroyed  both himself and the whole army which was with him  (for he thought that they would all set upon him if they were informed of that which had happened ) — reflecting  I say  upon this he had told nothing of it to the Phokians  and now to the Thessalians he spoke as follows:I  as you see  Thessalians  am earnest to march by the shortest way to Thracia; and I am in great haste  having been sent with these men for a certain business from the army; moreover Mardonios himself and his army are shortly to be looked for here  marching close after me. To him give entertainment and show yourselves serviceable  for ye will not in the end repent of so doing. Having thus said he continued to march his army with haste through Thessaly and Macedonia straight for Thracia  being in truth earnest to proceed and going through the land by the shortest possible way: and so he came to Byzantion  having left behind him great numbers of his army  who had either been cut down by the Thracians on the way or had been overcome by hunger and fatigue; and from Byzantion he passed over in ships. He himself then thus made his return back to Asia.,mashup

Now on the same day on which the defeat took place at Plataia  another took place also  as fortune would have it  at Mycale in Ionia. For when the Hellenes who had come in the ships with Leotychides the Lacedemonian  were lying at Delos  there came to them as envoys from Samos Lampon the son of Thrasycles and Athenagoras the son of Archestratides and Hegesistratos the son of Aristagoras  who had been sent by the people of Samos without the knowledge either of the Persians or of the despot Theomestor the son of Androdamas  whom the Persians had set up to be despot of Samos. When these had been introduced before the commanders  Hegesistratos spoke at great length using arguments of all kinds  and saying that so soon as the Ionians should see them they would at once revolt from the Persians  and that the Barbarians would not wait for their attack; and if after all they did so  then the Hellenes would take a prize such as they would never take again hereafter; and appealing to the gods worshipped in common he endeavoured to persuade them to rescue from slavery men who were Hellenes and to drive away the Barbarian: and this he said was easy for them to do  for the ships of the enemy sailed badly and were no match for them in fight. Moreover if the Hellenes suspected that they were endeavouring to bring them on by fraud  they were ready to be taken as hostages in their ships.,mashup

Then as the stranger of Samos was urgent in his prayer  Leotychides inquired thus  either desiring to hear for the sake of the omen or perhaps by a chance which Providence brought about:Stranger of Samos  what is thy name ? He saidHegesistratos. The other cut short the rest of the speech  stopping all that Hegesistratos had intended to say further  and said:I accept the augury given in Hegesistratos  stranger of Samos. Do thou on thy part see that thou give us assurance  thou and the men who are with thee  that the Samians will without fail be our zealous allies  and after that sail away home.,mashup

To this man's father Euenios it happened as follows:— There are at this place Apollonia sheep sacred to the Sun  which during the day feed by a river running from Mount Lacmon through the land of Apollonia to the sea by the haven of Oricos; and by night they are watched by men chosen for this purpose  who are the most highly considered of the citizens for wealth and noble birth  each man having charge of them for a year; for the people of Apollonia set great store on these sheep by reason of an oracle: and they are folded in a cave at some distance from the city. Here at the time of which I speak this man Euenios was keeping watch over them  having been chosen for that purpose; and it happened one night that he fell asleep during his watch  and wolves came by into the cave and killed about sixty of the sheep. When he perceived this  he kept it secret and told no one  meaning to buy others and substitute them in the place of those that were killed. It was discovered however by the people of Apollonia that this had happened; and when they were informed of it  they brought him up before a court and condemned him to be deprived of his eyesight for having fallen asleep during his watch. But when they had blinded Euenios  forthwith after this their flocks ceased to bring forth young and their land to bear crops as before. Then prophesyings were uttered to them both at Dodona and also at Delphi  when they asked the prophets the cause of the evil which they were suffering  and they told them that they had done unjustly in depriving of his sight Euenios the watcher of the sacred sheep; for the gods of whom they inquired had themselves sent the wolves to attack the sheep; and they would not cease to take vengeance for him till the men of Apollonia should have paid to Euenios such satisfaction as he himself should choose and deem sufficient; and this being fulfilled  the gods would give to Euenios a gift of such a kind that many men would think him happy in that he possessed it.,mashup

These oracles then were uttered to them  and the people of Apollonia  making a secret of it  proposed to certain men of the citizens to manage the affair; and they managed it for them thus:— when Euenios was sitting on a seat in public  they came and sat by him  and conversed about other matters  and at last they came to sympathising with him in his misfortune; and thus leading him on they asked what satisfaction he should choose  if the people of Apollonia should undertake to give him satisfaction for that which they had done. He then  not having heard the oracle  made choice and said that if there should be given him the lands belonging to certain citizens  naming those whom he knew to possess the two best lots of land in Apollonia  and a dwelling-house also with these  which he knew to be the best house in the city — if he became the possessor of these  he said  he would have no anger against them for the future  and this satisfaction would be sufficient for him if it should be given. Then as he was thus speaking  the men who sat by him said interrupting him:Euenios  this satisfaction the Apolloniates pay to thee for thy blinding in accordance with the oracles which have been given to them. Upon this he was angry  being thus informed of the whole matter and considering that he had been deceived; and they bought the property from those who possessed it and gave him that which he had chosen. And forthwith after this he had a natural gift of divination  so that he became very famous.,mashup

Now when the sacrifices were favourable to the Hellenes  they put their ships to sea from Delos to go to Samos; and having arrived off Calamisa in Samos  they moored their ships there opposite the temple of Hera which is at this place  and made preparations for a sea-fight; but the Persians  being informed that they were sailing thither  put out to sea also and went over to the mainland with their remaining ships  (those of the Phenicians having been already sent away to sail home ): for deliberating of the matter they thought it good not to fight a battle by sea  since they did not think that they were a match for the enemy. And they sailed away to the mainland in order that they might be under the protection of their land-army which was in Mycale  a body which had stayed behind the rest of the army by command of Xerxes and was keeping watch over Ionia: of this the number was six myriads and the commander of it was Tigranes  who in beauty and stature excelled the other Persians. The commanders of the fleet then had determined to take refuge under the protection of this army  and to draw up their ships on shore and put an enclosure round as a protection for the ships and a refuge for themselves.,mashup

The Hellenes however  when they were informed that the Barbarians had gone away to the mainland  were vexed because they thought that they had escaped; and they were in a difficulty what they should do  whether they should go back home  or sail down towards the Hellespont. At last they resolved to do neither of these two things  but to sail on to the mainland. Therefore when they had prepared as for a sea- fight both boarding-bridges and all other things that were required  they sailed towards Mycale; and when they came near to the camp and no one was seen to put out against them  but they perceived ships drawn up within the wall and a large land-army ranged along the shore  then first Leotychides  sailing along in his ship and coming as near to the shore as he could  made proclamation by a herald to the Ionians  saying:Ionians  those of you who chance to be within hearing of me  attend to this which I say: for the Persians will not understand anything at all of that which I enjoin to you. When we join battle  each one of you must remember first the freedom of all  and then the watchword 'Hebe'; and this let him also who has not heard know from him who has heard. The design in this act was the same as that of Themistocles at Artemision; for it was meant that either the words uttered should escape the knowledge of the Barbarians and persuade the Ionians  or that they should be reported to the Barbarians and make them distrustful of the Hellenes.,mashup

After Leotychides had thus suggested  then next the Hellenes proceeded to bring their ships up to land  and they disembarked upon the shore. These then were ranging themselves for fight; and the Persians  when they saw the Hellenes preparing for battle and also that they had given exhortation to the Ionians  in the first place deprived the Samians of their arms  suspecting that they were inclined to the side of the Hellenes; for when the Athenian prisoners  the men whom the army of Xerxes had found left behind in Attica  had come in the ships of the Barbarians  the Samians had ransomed these and sent them back to Athens  supplying them with means for their journey; and for this reason especially they were suspected  since they had ransomed five hundred persons of the enemies of Xerxes. Then secondly the Persians appointed the Milesians to guard the passes which lead to the summits of Mycale  on the pretext that they knew the country best  but their true reason for doing this was that they might be out of the camp. Against these of the Ionians  who  as they suspected  would make some hostile move if they found the occasion  the Persians sought to secure themselves in the manner mentioned; and they themselves then brought together their wicker-work shields to serve them as a fence.,mashup

Then when the Hellenes had made all their preparations  they proceeded to the attack of the Barbarians; and as they went  a rumour came suddenly to their whole army  and at the same time a herald's staff was found lying upon the beach; and the rumour went through their army to this effect  namely that the Hellenes were fighting in Boeotia and conquering the army of Mardonios. Now by many signs is the divine power seen in earthly things  and by this among others  namely that now  when the day of the defeat at Plataia and of that which was about to take place at Mycale happened to be the same  a rumour came to the Hellenes here  so that the army was encouraged much more and was more eagerly desirous to face the danger.,mashup

Moreover this other thing by coincidence happened besides  namely that there was a sacred enclosure of the Eleusinian Demeter close by the side of both the battle-fields; for not only in the Plataian land did the fight take place close by the side of the temple of Demeter  as I have before said  but also in Mycale it was to be so likewise. And whereas the rumour which came to them said that a victory had been already gained by the Hellenes with Pausanias  this proved to be a true report; for that which was done at Plataia came about while it was yet early morning  but the fighting at Mycale took place in the afternoon; and that it happened on the same day of the same month as the other became evident to them not long afterwards  when they inquired into the matter. Now they had been afraid before the rumour arrived  not for themselves so much as for the Hellenes generally  lest Hellas should stumble and fall over Mardonios; but when this report had come suddenly to them  they advanced on the enemy much more vigorously and swiftly than before. The Hellenes then and the Barbarians were going with eagerness into the battle  since both the islands and the Hellespont were placed before them as prizes of the contest.,mashup

Now for the Athenians and those who were ranged next to them  to the number perhaps of half the whole army  the road lay along the sea- beach and over level ground  while the Lacedemonians and those ranged in order by these were compelled to go by a ravine and along the mountain side: so while the Lacedemonians were yet going round  those upon the other wing were already beginning the fight; and as long as the wicker-work shields of the Persians still remained upright  they continued to defend themselves and had rather the advantage in the fight; but when the troops of the Athenians and of those ranged next to them  desiring that the achievement should belong to them and not to the Lacedemonians  with exhortations to one another set themselves more vigorously to the work  then from that time forth the fortune of the fight was changed; for these pushed aside the wicker-work shields and fell upon the Persians with a rush all in one body  and the Persians sustained their first attack and continued to defend themselves for a long time  but at last they fled to the wall; and the Athenians  Corinthians  Sikyonians and Troizenians  for that was the order in which they were ranged  followed close after them and rushed in together with them to the space within the wall: and when the wall too had been captured  then the Barbarians no longer betook themselves to resistance  but began at once to take flight  excepting only the Persians  who formed into small groups and continued to fight with the Hellenes as they rushed in within the wall. Of the commanders of the Persians two made their escape and two were slain; Arta�ntes and Ithamitres commanders of the fleet escaped  while Mardontes and the commander of the land-army  Tigranes  were slain.,mashup

The Milesians too had been appointed to watch the passes of the Persians in order to secure their safety  so that if that should after all come upon them which actually came  they might have guides and so get safe away to the summits of Mycale — the Milesians  I say  had been appointed to do this  not only for that end but also for fear that  if they were present in the camp  they might make some hostile move: but they did in fact the opposite of that which they were appointed to do; for they not only directed them in the flight by other than the right paths  by paths indeed which led towards the enemy  but also at last they themselves became their worst foes and began to slay them.

When the Hellenes had slain the greater number of the Barbarians  some in the battle and others in their flight  they set fire to the ships and to the whole of the wall  having first brought out the spoil to the sea-shore; and among the rest they found some stores of money. So having set fire to the wall and to the ships they sailed away; and when they came to Samos  the Hellenes deliberated about removing the inhabitants of Ionia  and considered where they ought to settle them in those parts of Hellas of which they had command  leaving Ionia to the Barbarians: for it was evident to them that it was impossible on the one hand for them to be always stationed as guards to protect the Ionians  and on the other hand  if they were not stationed to protect them  they had no hope that the Ionians would escape with impunity from the Persians. Therefore it seemed good to those of the Peloponnesians that were in authority that they should remove the inhabitants of the trading ports which belonged to those peoples of Hellas who had taken the side of the Medes  and give that land to the Ionians to dwell in; but the Athenians did not think it good that the inhabitants of Ionia should be removed at all  nor that the Peloponnesians should consult about Athenian colonies; and as these vehemently resisted the proposal  the Peloponnesians gave way. So the end was that they joined as allies to their league the Samians  Chians  Lesbians  and the other islanders who chanced to be serving with the Hellenes  binding them by assurance and by oaths to remain faithful and not withdraw from the league: and having bound these by oaths they sailed to break up the bridges  for they supposed they would find them still stretched over the straits. These then were sailing towards the Hellespont;,mashup

Now with the Persians to be called worse than a woman is the greatest possible reproach. So he  after he had been much reviled  at length became angry and drew his sword upon Masistes  meaning to kill him; and as he was running upon him  Xeinagoras the son of Prexilaos  a man of Halicarnassos  perceived it  who was standing just behind Arta�ntes; and this man seized him by the middle and lifting him up dashed him upon the ground; and meanwhile the spearmen of Masistes came in front to protect him. Thus did Xeinagoras  and thus he laid up thanks for himself both with Masistes and also with Xerxes for saving the life of his brother; and for this deed Xeinagoras became ruler of all Kilikia by the gift of the king. Nothing further happened than this as they went on their way  but they arrived at Sardis. Now at Sardis  as it chanced  king Xerxes had been staying ever since that time when he came thither in flight from Athens  after suffering defeat in the sea-fight.,mashup

At that time  while he was in Sardis  he had a passionate desire  as it seems  for the wife of Masistes  who was also there: and as she could not be bent to his will by his messages to her  and he did not wish to employ force because he had regard for his brother Masistes and the same consideration withheld the woman also  for she well knew that force would not be used towards her )  then Xerxes abstained from all else  and endeavoured to bring about the marriage of his own son Dareios with the daughter of this woman and of Masistes  supposing that if he should do so he would obtain her more easily. Then having made the betrothal and done all the customary rites  he went away to Susa; and when he had arrived there and had brought the woman into his own house for Dareios  then he ceased from attempting the wife of Masistes and changing his inclination he conceived a desire for the wife of Dareios  who was daughter of Masistes  and obtained her: now the name of this woman was Arta�nte.,mashup

However as time went on  this became known in the following manner:— Amestris the wife of Xerxes had woven a mantle  large and of various work and a sight worthy to be seen  and this she gave to Xerxes. He then being greatly pleased put it on and went to Arta�nte; and being greatly pleased with her too  he bade her ask what she would to be given to her in return for the favours which she had granted to him  for she should obtain  he said  whatsoever she asked: and she  since it was destined that she should perish miserably with her whole house  said to Xerxes upon this:Wilt thou give me whatsoever I ask thee for ? and he  supposing that she would ask anything rather than that which she did  promised this and swore to it. Then when he had sworn  she boldly asked for the mantle; and Xerxes tried every means of persuasion  not being willing to give it to her  and that for no other reason but only because he feared Amestris  lest by her  who even before this had some inkling of the truth  he should thus be discovered in the act; and he offered her cities and gold in any quantity  and an army which no one else should command except herself. Now this of an army is a thoroughly Persian gift. Since however he did not persuade her  he gave her the mantle; and she being overjoyed by the gift wore it and prided herself upon it.,mashup

And Amestris was informed that she had it; and having learnt that which was being done  she was not angry with the woman  but supposing that her mother was the cause and that she was bringing this about  she planned destruction for the wife of Masistes. She waited then until her husband Xerxes had a royal feast set before him:— this feast is served up once in the year on the day on which the king was born  and the name of this feast is in Persian  tycta  which in the tongue of the Hellenes meanscomplete; also on this occasion alone the king washes his head  and he makes gifts then to the Persians:— Amestris  I say  waited for this day and then asked of Xerxes that the wife of Masistes might be given to her. And he considered it a strange and untoward thing to deliver over to her his brother's wife  especially since she was innocent of this matter; for he understood why she was making the request.,mashup

At last however as she continued to entreat urgently and he was compelled by the rule  namely that it is impossible among them that he who makes request when a royal feast is laid before the king should fail to obtain it  at last very much against his will consented; and in delivering her up he bade Amestris do as she desired  and meanwhile he sent for his brother and said these words:Masistes  thou art the son of Dareios and my brother  and moreover in addition to this thou art a man of worth. I say to thee  live no longer with this wife with whom thou now livest  but I give thee instead of her my daughter; with her live as thy wife  but the wife whom thou now hast  do not keep; for it does not seem good to me that thou shouldest keep her. Masistes then  marvelling at that which was spoken  said these words:Master  how unprofitable a speech is this which thou utterest to me  in that thou biddest me send away a wife by whom I have sons who are grown up to be young men  and daughters one of whom even thou thyself didst take as a wife for thy son  and who is herself  as it chances  very much to my mind — that thou biddest me  I say  send away her and take to wife thy daughter! I  O king  think it a very great matter that I am judged worthy of thy daughter  but nevertheless I will do neither of these things: and do not thou urge me by force to do such a thing as this: but for thy daughter another husband will be found not in any wise inferior to me  and let me  I pray thee  live still with my own wife. He returned answer in some such words as these; and Xerxes being stirred with anger said as follows:This then  Masistes  is thy case — I will not give thee my daughter for thy wife  nor yet shalt thou live any longer with that one  in order that thou mayest learn to accept that which is offered thee. He then when he heard this went out  having first said these words:Master  thou hast not surely brought ruin upon me ?,mashup

During this interval of time  while Xerxes was conversing with his brother  Amestris had sent the spearmen of Xerxes to bring the wife of Masistes  and she was doing to her shameful outrage; for she cut away her breasts and threw them to dogs  and she cut off her nose and ears and lips and tongue  and sent her back home thus outraged.,mashup

Then Masistes  not yet having heard any of these things  but supposing that some evil had fallen upon him  came running to his house; and seeing his wife thus mutilated  forthwith upon this he took counsel with his sons and set forth to go to Bactria together with his sons and doubtless some others also  meaning to make the province of Bactria revolt and to do the greatest possible injury to the king: and this in fact would have come to pass  as I imagine  if he had got up to the land of the Bactrians and Sacans before he was overtaken  for they were much attached to him  and also he was the governor of the Bactrians: but Xerxes being informed that he was doing this  sent after him an army as he was on his way  and slew both him and his sons and his army.

So the Peloponnesians which Leotychides resolved to sail back to Hellas  while the Athenians and Xanthippos their commander determined to stay behind there and to make an attempt upon the Chersonese.

And of the province Artaÿctes was despot  as governor under Xerxes  a Persian  but a man of desperate and reckless character  who also had practised deception upon the king on his march against Athens  in taking away from Elaius the things belonging to Protesilaos the son of Iphiclos. For at Elaius in the Chersonese there is the tomb of Protesilaos with a sacred enclosure about it  where there were many treasures  with gold and silver cups and bronze and raiment and other offerings  which things Artaÿctes carried off as plunder  the king having granted them to him. And he deceived Xerxes by saying to him some such words as these:Master  there is here the house of a man  a Hellene  who made an expedition against thy land and met with his deserts and was slain: this man's house I ask thee to give to me  that every one may learn not to make expeditions against thy land. By saying this it was likely that he would easily enough persuade Xerxes to give him a man's house  not suspecting what was in his mind: and when he said that Protesilaos had made expedition against the land of the king  it must be understood that the Persians consider all Asia to be theirs and to belong to their reigning king. So when the things had been given him  he brought them from Elaius to Sestos  and he sowed the sacred enclosure for crops and occupied it as his own; and he himself  whenever he came to Elaius  had commerce with women in the inner cell of the temple. And now he was being besieged by the Athenians  when he had not made any preparation for a siege nor had been expecting that the Hellenes would come; for they fell upon him  as one may say  inevitably.,mashup

When however autumn came and the siege still went on  the Athenians began to be vexed at being absent from their own land and at the same time not able to conquer the fortress  and they requested their commanders to lead them away home; but these said that they would not do so  until either they had taken the town or the public authority of the Athenians sent for them home: and so they endured their present state.,mashup

Those however who were within the walls had now come to the greatest misery  so that they boiled down the girths of their beds and used them for food; and when they no longer had even these  then the Persians and with them Artaÿctes and Oiobazos ran away and departed in the night  climbing down by the back part of the wall  where the place was left most unguarded by the enemy; and when day came  the men of the Chersonese signified to the Athenians from the towers concerning that which had happened  and opened the gates to them.

Protesilaos who dwells at Elaius signifies thereby that though he is dead and his body is dried like those fish  yet he has power given him by the gods to exact vengeance from the man who does him wrong. Now therefore I desire to impose this penalty for him — that in place of the things which I took from the temple I should pay down a hundred talents to the god  and moreover as ransom for myself and my son I will pay two hundred talents to the Athenians  if my life be spared. Thus he engaged to do  but he did not prevail upon the commander Xanthippos; for the people of Elaius desiring to take vengeance for Protesilaos asked that he might be put to death  and the inclination of the commander himself tended to the same conclusion. They brought him therefore to that headland to which Xerxes made the passage across  or as some say to the hill which is over the town of Madytos  and there they nailed him to boards and hung him up; and they stoned his son to death before the eyes of Artaÿctes himself.,mashup

Καὶ κατὰ τὸ ἔτος τοῦτο οὐδὲν ἐπὶ πλέον τούτων ἐγένετο. Having so done  they sailed away to Hellas  taking with them  besides other things  the ropes also of the bridges  in order to dedicate them as offerings in the temples: and for that year nothing happened further than this.,mashup

Now a forefather of this Artaÿctes who was hung up  was that Artembares who set forth to the Persians a proposal which they took up and brought before Cyrus  being to this effect:Seeing that Zeus grants to the Persians leadership  and of all men to thee  O Cyrus  by destroying Astyages  come  since the land we possess is small and also rugged  let us change from it and inhabit another which is better: and there are many near at hand  and many also at a greater distance  of which if we take one  we shall have greater reverence and from more men. It is reasonable too that men who are rulers should do such things; for when will there ever be a fairer occasion than now  when we are rulers of many nations and of the whole of Asia ? Cyrus  hearing this and not being surprised at the proposal  bade them do so if they would; but he exhorted them and bade them prepare in that case to be no longer rulers but subjects;For  said he from lands which are not rugged men who are not rugged are apt to come forth  since it does not belong to the same land to bring forth fruits of the earth which are admirable and also men who are good in war. So the Persians acknowledged that he was right and departed from his presence  having their opinion defeated by that of Cyrus; and they chose rather to dwell on poor land and be rulers  than to sow crops in a level plain and be slaves to others.,mashup
